Simulating Human Steps in SPCP with Prompts for a Smaller LLM

(Assumption: We are picking up where the previous workflow explicitly stated [HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED] or similar.)

Simulating Step 2 Human Actions: Selecting Scrutiny Points & Finalizing Step 2 Doc

Context: The LLM previously generated lists of potential assumptions (POS-A#) and potential scrutiny points (CR-C#) based on generic checks (Prompts 2.1 & 2.2 in the previous response).
Human Task Being Simulated: Reviewing these brainstormed lists, selecting the most relevant and impactful assumptions and scrutiny points, identifying specific POS-E#, and mapping the actual logic.
Python

# Assume 'assumptions_and_scrutiny_draft' contains LLM brainstorm for POS-A# / CR-C#
# Assume 'logic_evidence_and_scrutiny_draft' contains LLM brainstorm for Logic / POS-E# / CR-C#

# Enhanced Prompt 2.X (Attempt to Prioritize Scrutiny Points - Experimental)
prompt_2_prioritize_critiques = f"""
Review the brainstormed 'Potential Scrutiny Points' (CR-C#) listed below for Assumptions, Logic, and Evidence.

Brainstormed Scrutiny Points (Combined):
---
# Combine the CR-C# points generated by the LLM in the previous Step 2 prompts
{assumptions_and_scrutiny_draft}
{logic_evidence_and_scrutiny_draft}
---
Original Position Summary (for context): {step1_doc['Summary of Position Under Review']}

**Instructions & Rules for Prioritization Simulation:**
1.  **Identify Critical Keywords:** Look for scrutiny points (CR-C#) containing keywords suggesting high impact or fundamental flaws (e.g., "unsupported assumption," "logical gap," "contradicts core claim," "ignores key risk," "evidence irrelevant").
2.  **Count Keyword Occurrences:** Count how many identified scrutiny points seem potentially critical based on keywords.
3.  **List Potentially High Priority CR-C#:** List the IDs (CR-C#) that contain critical keywords.
4.  **Output Format:**
    * Potentially High Priority Scrutiny Points (CR-C# IDs): [List IDs]
    * Count of Potentially High Priority Points: [Number]
    * **Analyst Note:** [Add this exact text: "PRIORITIZATION IS HEURISTIC ONLY. HUMAN MUST REVIEW ALL CR-C# AND SELECT THE MOST RELEVANT/IMPACTFUL ONES FOR STEP 3 BASED ON ACTUAL READING OF THE POSITION."]

**Prioritization Simulation:**

# --- !!! CRITICAL HUMAN STEP (UNAVOIDABLE) !!! ---
# The human analyst *must* review the original position text, the LLM's brainstormed POS-A#, POS-E#, logic outline,
# and CR-C# points, AND the prioritization suggestion.
# The human *selects*, *refines*, and potentially *rewrites* the final set of POS-A#, POS-E#, logic map,
# and the specific CR-C# points that will actually be pursued in Step 3.
# The human then compiles the final Step 2 document based on their own critical reading and selection.
# step2_doc = { ... compiled with HUMAN-SELECTED AND REFINED findings ... }
Simulating Step 3 Human Actions: Writing Substantiated Critique & Assessing Strength

Context: The LLM previously drafted a simple critique statement and identified evidence needs (Prompt 3.1). The human guided a search, finding specific CR-E## evidence. The LLM summarized CR-E## and did simple linking (Prompt 3.2a/b).
Human Task Being Simulated: Taking all this, writing the logical, well-reasoned paragraph that constitutes the substantiated critique, weaving in the CR-E## evidence correctly while considering its quality (from human notes), and assessing the critique's overall strength.
Python

# Assume 'final_critique_statement' (human-refined), 'critique_evidence_log_entries' (human-gathered CR-E## + quality notes),
# and 'evidence_support_assessment' (LLM's simple Yes/No linking) exist for a specific CR-C#.

# Enhanced Prompt 3.X (Attempt to Draft Substantiated Critique - HIGH RISK / Experimental)
prompt_3_draft_substantiated_critique_simple = f"""
Combine the Critique Statement and Supporting Evidence into a draft paragraph. Follow the structure closely.

Critique Statement for {scrutiny_point_id}: "{final_critique_statement}"

Supporting Evidence (CR-E## with Quality Notes):
---
{critique_evidence_log_entries} # Includes human quality notes
---
Simple Evidence Support Assessment (LLM generated Yes/No):
---
{evidence_support_assessment}
---

**Instructions & Rules for Drafting Substantiated Critique:**
1.  **Start with Statement:** Begin the paragraph with the 'Critique Statement'.
2.  **Incorporate Supporting Evidence:** For each piece of evidence (CR-E##) marked 'Yes' or 'Partially' in the 'Simple Evidence Support Assessment', add a sentence explaining *how* it supports the critique statement. Reference the Evidence ID (CR-E##). Briefly mention its quality if noted (e.g., "Reliable data CR-E01 shows...").
3.  **Acknowledge Contradictions/Weakness (If Any):** If evidence was marked 'No' or quality notes indicate weakness, briefly mention this limitation (e.g., "although evidence CR-E0X is weak...").
4.  **Attempt Strength Assessment:** Based *only* on the number of 'Yes' support links and the mentioned quality notes, make a *tentative* guess for strength (High/Medium/Low). Use keywords like: "Strength Assessment Guess: [High/Medium/Low] because [mention number of supporting pieces or quality keywords found]".
5.  **Output Format:** A single paragraph containing the argument and evidence integration, followed by the tentative Strength Assessment Guess.
6.  **Add Warning:** Conclude with the exact text: "**HUMAN VALIDATION REQUIRED: This draft may contain logical errors or misinterpret evidence quality. Review critically.**"

# --- !!! CRITICAL HUMAN STEP (UNAVOIDABLE) !!! ---
# The human analyst *must* take this LLM draft, compare it against the actual evidence (CR-E##) and their
# own understanding, rewrite the argument for logical flow and accurate representation of evidence strength,
# ensure quality assessments are properly considered, and assign the *final, definitive* Strength Assessment.
# The LLM draft is highly likely to be superficial or logically flawed here.
# final_substantiated_critique_section = "[HUMAN WRITES the final version, likely rewriting the LLM draft substantially]"

Simulating Step 4 Human Actions: Determining Impact & Formulating Recommendations

Context: LLM previously drafted summaries of critiques and brainstormed potential impacts and generic recommendation types (Prompts 4.1-4.4 in the simplified workflow).
Human Task Being Simulated: Synthesizing the critiques to judge the overall impact severity (CR-R1, R2...) and formulating specific, actionable recommendations (CR-R3, R4...). Also, writing the final Limitations & Confidence section.
Python

# Assume 'key_critiques_summary_list' (LLM generated list) exists
# Assume 'potential_impacts_list' (LLM brainstormed potential consequences for each critique) exists
# Assume 'recommendation_types_list' (LLM brainstormed generic actions for critique types) exists

# Enhanced Prompt 4.X (Attempt to Draft Overall Impact - Highly Speculative)
prompt_4_draft_impact_simple = f"""
Review the critiques and their potential impacts. Attempt to synthesize an overall impact assessment.

Key Critiques Summary List:
---
{key_critiques_summary_list}
---
Potential Impacts List:
---
{potential_impacts_list}
---
Original Position Summary: {step1_doc['Summary of Position Under Review']}

**Instructions & Rules for Drafting Impact Assessment:**
1.  **Count Strong Critiques:** Count how many key critiques were listed (assume they represent significant issues).
2.  **Identify Affected Position Points:** Note which original position points (POS-P# from Step 1 summary) are mentioned most often in the 'Potential Impacts List'.
3.  **Draft Severity Statement:** Based on the count and affected points, draft a *tentative* statement about overall impact severity (e.g., "Multiple critiques suggest the core conclusion POS-P2 is significantly weakened," "Several critiques indicate high risk for plan element POS-P1"). Use cautious language ("suggests," "indicates potential"). Label impact points CR-R1, CR-R2...
4.  **Add Warning:** Conclude with the exact text: "**HUMAN JUDGMENT REQUIRED: This impact assessment is speculative, based on simple counts and keywords. Analyst must determine actual severity.**"

**Draft Assessment of Overall Impact (Requires Human Validation):**
"""
draft_impact_assessment = llm_generate(prompt_4_draft_impact_simple)

---
{key_critiques_summary_list} # Includes CR-C# labels
---
Generic Recommendation Types List:
---
{recommendation_types_list} # Pairs like ('If assumption questioned' -> 'Suggest: Test assumption')
---

**Instructions & Rules for Drafting Recommendations:**
1.  **Match Critique to Action:** For each specific critique in the 'Key Critiques Summary List' (CR-C#), find the most relevant 'Generic Recommendation Type' from the list.
2.  **Make Specific:** Turn the generic action into a specific recommendation related to the critique. Mention the CR-C# it addresses. Label sequentially CR-R{next_cr_r_id}...
3.  **Example:** If CR-C1 questioned Assumption POS-A1, and a generic type is "Test assumption," draft could be: "CR-R3: Gather direct user data to test conversion assumption POS-A1 (addresses CR-C1)."
4.  **Format:** List the specific, drafted recommendations with CR-R# labels.
5.  **Add Warning:** Conclude with the exact text: "**HUMAN VALIDATION REQUIRED: These recommendations are drafted based on simple matching. Analyst must ensure they are relevant, actionable, and appropriate.**"

Conclusion on Automating Human Steps (Especially for Small LLMs):

As demonstrated, attempting to automate the core judgment steps results in prompts that ask the LLM to perform very basic pattern matching or follow simple heuristics. The outputs are labeled as speculative, tentative, or requiring validation because a small LLM cannot replicate nuanced human critical thinking, context understanding, or credibility assessment.

Therefore, while these prompts illustrate how one might try to use an LLM for these steps, the strong recommendation remains: keep a human analyst firmly in the loop for all steps involving critical assessment, synthesis, judgment, and validation, especially when working with less capable models. These prompts might serve as very rough first drafts or checklists for the human, but not as replacements for their expertise.
