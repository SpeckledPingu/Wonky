[{"prompt": "\n## Domestic Policy Overview - Structured Document Template\n\n**Objective:** To capture essential domestic policy information from an analytical report in a structured format, using a combination of verbatim quotes and concise, rule-based summaries, allowing for analysis of policies within any given domestic jurisdiction.\n\n**General Rules for Information Extraction (Applicable to all fields unless overridden by specific field rules):**\n\n1.  **Source Adherence:** All extracted information must originate directly from the provided report. No external information, assumptions, or interpretations are to be introduced.\n2.  **Attribution [id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]:** Whenever possible, provide general attribution by citing the page number(s) or specific section(s)/heading(s) of the report from which the information was extracted. This is especially critical for verbatim quotes and key analytical points. This general attribution is distinct from, and should be provided in addition to, any specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` markers captured under Rule 7.\n3.  **Verbatim Quotes:**\n    * Rule 3.1: Use verbatim quotes when the report presents official statements, policy declarations, definitions of key terms, or when the precise wording is essential for conveying meaning or nuance.\n    * Rule 3.2: Enclose all verbatim quotes in quotation marks (\" \").\n    * Rule 3.3: If a quote is lengthy and a concise summary can accurately capture its essence for a particular field, a summary may be used, but the option to include the full quote (perhaps in an appendix or a supplementary note field if we add one later) should be considered. The primary field should prioritize conciseness if a summary is adequate.\n4.  **Paraphrased Summaries:**\n    * Rule 4.1: Use paraphrased summaries for explaining complex concepts, synthesizing information from multiple parts of the report, or when the original text is too lengthy for the field's purpose.\n    * Rule 4.2: Summaries must accurately reflect the source material's meaning, including any stated assumptions or conclusions presented in the report related to the summarized point.\n    * Rule 4.3: Maintain neutral language. Avoid loaded terms or phrasing that introduces bias not present in the source.\n    * Rule 4.4: Strive for conciseness while ensuring completeness of the relevant information for that field.\n5.  **\"Not Specified in Report\":** If, after a thorough review, the information required for a field cannot be found in the report, enter \"Not Specified in Report.\" Do not leave fields blank.\n6.  **Consistency:** Apply heuristics and rules consistently across all reports analyzed.\n7.  **Handling Specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` Citation Pattern:**\n    * Rule 7.1: While processing the source document text, be vigilant for citation markers matching the **exact alphanumeric pattern**: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n        * `id_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for the document.\n        * `section_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a section.\n        * `subsection_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a subsection.\n        * Double underscores (`__`) separate `id_ref` from `section_ref`.\n        * Triple underscores (`___`) separate `section_ref` from `subsection_ref`.\n    * Rule 7.2: If such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is identified *within the text segment being extracted* (either for a verbatim quote or as the basis for a summary) AND this pattern is used by the source document to refer to its own sections/subsections or those of closely related internal documents explicitly part of the same corpus:\n        * Rule 7.2.1: If the extraction is a verbatim quote, this `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern, if present in the quoted material, must be included as part of the quote.\n        * Rule 7.2.2: When such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is present in the text segment being extracted (whether quoted or summarized), this specific marker string (e.g., `[doc001__sec02___subA]`) MUST be preserved and included as part of the output for the relevant field.\n            * *Example:* If the extracted content for a field is 'The program funding was increased by 10%.' (attributed to 'p. 15, Budget Allocation Section' per Rule 2), and the original source text for this statement also contained the marker `[report42__budget01___increaseA]`, then the final entry for that field should be: 'The program funding was increased by 10%. `[report42__budget01___increaseA]`'.\n    * Rule 7.3: This rule (Rule 7) details how to handle the specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker when found in the source text. The general page/section attribution from Rule 2 (e.g. page number or general section heading) should ideally still be noted by the analyst for traceability, even if the final output format for the field emphasizes the `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker as shown in the Rule 7.2.2 example.\n    * Rule 7.4: Only the exact `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is to be considered a valid citation marker for capture under this Rule 7. Other citation forms, such as numerical footnote markers (e.g., \"\\[1\\]\", \"\\[23\\]\"), author-date citations (e.g., \"(Smith, 2020)\"), or textual references like \"see the section on X,\" are **not** to be captured or treated under this Rule 7. Such other citation forms may be part of a verbatim quote if they fall within the quoted text but should not be separately extracted or appended as if they were a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker.\n8. **Citation Requirements:**\n    * Every statement you write that is extracted from the text must be cited back to the general citation format that is in the document: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n    * Never provide a statement that does not have this citation because it is critical to validating the information in the report. If a specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is not present for a piece of information, use the general page/section attribution from Rule 2. The ideal is to have the specific marker; if absent, general attribution is the minimum.\n\n---\n\n**1.

No external information, assumptions, or interpretations are to be introduced.\n2.  **Attribution [id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]:** Whenever possible, provide general attribution by citing the page number(s) or specific section(s)/heading(s) of the report from which the information was extracted. This is especially critical for verbatim quotes and key analytical points. This general attribution is distinct from, and should be provided in addition to, any specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` markers captured under Rule 7.\n3.  **Verbatim Quotes:**\n    * Rule 3.1: Use verbatim quotes when the report presents official statements, policy declarations, definitions of key terms, or when the precise wording is essential for conveying meaning or nuance.\n    * Rule 3.2: Enclose all verbatim quotes in quotation marks (\" \").\n    * Rule 3.3: If a quote is lengthy and a concise summary can accurately capture its essence for a particular field, a summary may be used, but the option to include the full quote (perhaps in an appendix or a supplementary note field if we add one later) should be considered. The primary field should prioritize conciseness if a summary is adequate.\n4.  **Paraphrased Summaries:**\n    * Rule 4.1: Use paraphrased summaries for explaining complex concepts, synthesizing information from multiple parts of the report, or when the original text is too lengthy for the field's purpose.\n    * Rule 4.2: Summaries must accurately reflect the source material's meaning, including any stated assumptions or conclusions presented in the report related to the summarized point.\n    * Rule 4.3: Maintain neutral language. Avoid loaded terms or phrasing that introduces bias not present in the source.\n    * Rule 4.4: Strive for conciseness while ensuring completeness of the relevant information for that field.\n5.  **\"Not Specified in Report\":** If, after a thorough review, the information required for a field cannot be found in the report, enter \"Not Specified in Report.\" Do not leave fields blank.\n6.  **Consistency:** Apply heuristics and rules consistently across all reports analyzed.\n7.  **Handling Specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` Citation Pattern:**\n    * Rule 7.1: While processing the source document text, be vigilant for citation markers matching the **exact alphanumeric pattern**: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n        * `id_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for the document.\n        * `section_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a section.\n        * `subsection_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a subsection.\n        * Double underscores (`__`) separate `id_ref` from `section_ref`.\n        * Triple underscores (`___`) separate `section_ref` from `subsection_ref`.\n    * Rule 7.2: If such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is identified *within the text segment being extracted* (either for a verbatim quote or as the basis for a summary) AND this pattern is used by the source document to refer to its own sections/subsections or those of closely related internal documents explicitly part of the same corpus:\n        * Rule 7.2.1: If the extraction is a verbatim quote, this `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern, if present in the quoted material, must be included as part of the quote.\n        * Rule 7.2.2: When such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is present in the text segment being extracted (whether quoted or summarized), this specific marker string (e.g., `[doc001__sec02___subA]`) MUST be preserved and included as part of the output for the relevant field. It should be presented alongside the general attribution from Rule 2.\n            * *Example:* If the extracted content for a field is 'The initiative was deemed successful.' (attributed to 'p. 15, Evaluation Section' per Rule 2), and the original source text for this statement also contained the marker `[report42__eval01___successA]`, then the final entry for that field should be: '`[report42__eval01___successA]`'.\n    * Rule 7.3: This rule (Rule 7) details how to handle the specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker when found in the source text. The general page/section attribution from Rule 2 must still be provided for all extracted information.\n    * Rule 7.4: Only the exact `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is to be considered a valid citation marker for capture under this Rule 7. Other citation forms, such as numerical footnote markers (e.g., \"\\[1\\]\", \"\\[23\\]\"), author-date citations (e.g., \"(Smith, 2020)\"), or textual references like \"see the section on X,\" are **not** to be captured or treated under this Rule 7. Such other citation forms may be part of a verbatim quote if they fall within the quoted text but should not be separately extracted or appended as if they were a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker.\n8. **Citation Requirements:**\n    * Every statement you write that is extracted from the text must be cited back to the general citation format that is in the document: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n    * Never provide a statement that does not have this citation because it is critical to validating the information in the report.\n\n---\n\n**1.

This general attribution is distinct from, and should be provided in addition to, any specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` markers captured under Rule 7.\n3.  **Verbatim Quotes:**\n    * Rule 3.1: Use verbatim quotes when the report presents official statements, policy declarations, definitions of key terms, or when the precise wording is essential for conveying meaning or nuance.\n    * Rule 3.2: Enclose all verbatim quotes in quotation marks (\" \").\n    * Rule 3.3: If a quote is lengthy and a concise summary can accurately capture its essence for a particular field, a summary may be used. The primary field should prioritize conciseness if a summary is adequate.\n4.  **Paraphrased Summaries:**\n    * Rule 4.1: Use paraphrased summaries for explaining complex concepts, synthesizing information from multiple parts of the report, or when the original text is too lengthy for the field's purpose.\n    * Rule 4.2: Summaries must accurately reflect the source material's meaning, including any stated assumptions or conclusions presented in the report related to the summarized point.\n    * Rule 4.3: Maintain neutral language. Avoid loaded terms or phrasing that introduces bias not present in the source.\n    * Rule 4.4: Strive for conciseness while ensuring completeness of the relevant information for that field.\n5.  **\"Not Specified in Report\":** If, after a thorough review, the information required for a field cannot be found in the report, enter \"Not Specified in Report.\" Do not leave fields blank. If a section asks for both \"Pros\" and \"Cons\" (or similar contrasting aspects) and the report only details one, state \"Not Specified in Report\" for the missing aspect.\n6.  **Consistency:** Apply heuristics and rules consistently across all reports analyzed.\n7.  **Handling Specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` Citation Pattern:**\n    * Rule 7.1: While processing the source document text, be vigilant for citation markers matching the **exact alphanumeric pattern**: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n        * `id_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for the document.\n        * `section_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a section.\n        * `subsection_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a subsection.\n        * Double underscores (`__`) separate `id_ref` from `section_ref`.\n        * Triple underscores (`___`) separate `section_ref` from `subsection_ref`.\n    * Rule 7.2: If such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is identified *within the text segment being extracted* (either for a verbatim quote or as the basis for a summary) AND this pattern is used by the source document to refer to its own sections/subsections or those of closely related internal documents explicitly part of the same corpus:\n        * Rule 7.2.1: If the extraction is a verbatim quote, this `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern, if present in the quoted material, must be included as part of the quote.\n        * Rule 7.2.2: When such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is present in the text segment being extracted (whether quoted or summarized), this specific marker string (e.g., `[doc001__sec02___subA]`) MUST be preserved and included as part of the output for the relevant field.\n            * *Example:* If the extracted content for a field is 'The policy led to a 5% increase in employment.' (attributed to 'p. 15, Economic Impact Section' per Rule 2), and the original source text for this statement also contained the marker `[report42__econImpact01___emplA]`, then the final entry for that field should be: 'The policy led to a 5% increase in employment. `[report42__econImpact01___emplA]`'.\n    * Rule 7.3: This rule (Rule 7) details how to handle the specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker when found in the source text. The general page/section attribution from Rule 2 (e.g. page number or general section heading) should ideally still be noted by the analyst for traceability, even if the final output format for the field emphasizes the `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker as shown in the Rule 7.2.2 example.\n    * Rule 7.4: Only the exact `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is to be considered a valid citation marker for capture under this Rule 7. Other citation forms, such as numerical footnote markers (e.g., \"\\[1\\]\", \"\\[23\\]\"), author-date citations (e.g., \"(Smith, 2020)\"), or textual references like \"see the section on X,\" are **not** to be captured or treated under this Rule 7. Such other citation forms may be part of a verbatim quote if they fall within the quoted text but should not be separately extracted or appended as if they were a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker.\n8. **Citation Requirements:**\n    * Every statement you write that is extracted from the text must be cited back to the general citation format that is in the document: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n    * Never provide a statement that does not have this citation because it is critical to validating the information in the report. If a specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is not present for a piece of information, use the general page/section attribution from Rule 2. The ideal is to have the specific marker; if absent, general attribution is the minimum.\n\n---\n\n**1.

For each stakeholder, you will produce a concise analytical brief that explains their role, interests, and demonstrated impact, supported by specific evidence from the text. Follow the rules and formatting instructions below.\n\n### **Analysis Rules**\n\n**Rule 1: Extract and Categorize All Actors.**\n* Scan Section 2 (`Key Domestic Actors, Entities, & Affected Groups Identified`) to compile a complete list of stakeholders.\n* For each stakeholder, assign one of the following categories: **Government Agency, Legislative Body, Private Sector, Association/Advocacy Group, or Affected Group**.\n\n**Rule 2: Determine Each Actor's Role, Stance, and Influence.**\n* For each actor, go to their subsection in Section 4 (`Detailed Analysis of Key Domestic Actors...`).\n* **2.1: Define Their Role.** What is their fundamental function in this policy area? (e.g., Is it regulatory, operational, funding-based, advocacy-focused, or are they a subject of the policy?) Look at the `Current Policy/Stance/Program Description or Role` field.\n* **2.2: Identify Their Stated Position.** What does the document say they want, believe, or have stated as an objective? Look at the `Stated Objectives, Position, Interests...` field. This reveals their intent.\n* **2.3: Identify Their Influence.** What power or action does the document show they can wield? Look at the `Policy Levers, Programs, or Actions...` field to find their levers of influence.\n\n**Rule 3: Select Relevant Evidence.**\n* For each actor, find 1-2 pieces of concrete, quantitative, or highly specific evidence that illustrates their role and influence in practice.\n* **3.1: Prioritize by Relevance.** The evidence you choose MUST be directly related to the research **Focus**. For example, if the focus is on \"funding,\" evidence of budgetary allocations is critical. If the focus is on \"safety,\" accident rate data is more relevant.\n* **3.2: Mine Key Fields.** Pull this evidence from fields like `Funding/Resource Allocation...`, `Reported Outcomes/Impacts/Effectiveness...`, and `Reported Challenges, Criticisms...`. Always include the citation `[ID__Section__Paragraph]` if available.\n\n### **Output Formatting**\n\n* Use a main heading: **Stakeholder Analysis for {subject}**\n* Use the categories from Rule 1 as your secondary headings.\n* Under each heading, create a brief for each stakeholder. Each brief should contain:\n    * The stakeholder's name in bold.\n    * A synthesized paragraph that integrates the findings from your analysis. It should start by stating their role (Rule 2.1), describe their position and influence (Rules 2.2 & 2.3), and seamlessly weave in the specific evidence you selected (Rule 3) to support the analysis. The goal is a flowing narrative, not a list of facts.\n\n---\nDOCUMENTS:\n{documents_text}\n---\n\nSTAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS:\n", "prompt_name": "stakeholder_analysis", "action_name": "stakeholder_analysis", "variables": ["subject", "focus", "documents_text"], "description": "A detailed stakeholder analysis based on the provided research document(s).", "source_target": ["crs_reports", "wikipedia", "generic"], "output_document_type": "analysis", "heuristic": "legal", "output_document_class": "analysis_derived_document"}, {"prompt": "\nYou are an expert communications strategist and policy analyst.

Then, format your final output as instructed.\n\n### **Analysis Rules**\n\n**Rule 1: Deconstruct the Audience and Viewpoint.**\nBefore reading the document, first deeply analyze the assignment context.\n* **1.1 Analyze the Target Audience:**\n    * **Priorities:** What are the likely primary concerns of this audience? (e.g., For a 'County Commissioner', priorities might be budget impact, local jobs, and constituent complaints. For 'Industry Lobbyists', priorities might be profit, market barriers, and regulation.)\n    * **Knowledge Level:** How much will this audience know about the topic? Frame your language accordingly. (e.g., Use technical terms for 'Federal Regulators'; use simple, direct language for a 'Community Town Hall'.)\n    * **Disposition:** What is their likely stance toward your viewpoint? (e.g., If 'friendly', reinforce shared values. If 'hostile', find common ground or focus on undeniable facts. If 'neutral', use data to build a logical case.)\n* **1.2 Analyze the Viewpoint to Advocate:**\n    * **Core Objective:** What is the ultimate goal? (e.g., To secure funding, to block a regulation, to encourage public support, to discredit an opposing view.)\n    * **Underlying Values:** What values does this viewpoint represent? (e.g., \"Fiscal responsibility,\" \"public safety,\" \"economic opportunity,\" \"innovation,\" \"equity.\") Your messaging should subtly appeal to these values.\n\n**Rule 2: Find and Align Evidence.**\n* With the context from Rule 1 in mind, thoroughly scan the document(s) for facts, statistics, policy details, and expert conclusions that can be used to support your **Viewpoint**.\n* Mine these key fields for evidence: `Current Status/Situation Overview`, `Policy Levers, Programs,or Actions...`, `Funding/Resource Allocation...`, `Reported Outcomes/Impacts/Effectiveness...`, and `Policy Options or Alternatives Discussed...`.\n* For each piece of evidence, consider how it can be framed to appeal to the **Audience's Priorities** and **Viewpoint's Values**.\n\n**Rule 3: Construct and Tailor Each Talking Point.**\n* For each talking point, construct two parts:\n    * **A. The Message:** A single, concise, and persuasive sentence. This message is your interpretation and argument. It should be explicitly tailored to the audience's priorities, knowledge level, and disposition as determined in Rule 1.1.\n    * **B. The Evidence:** The specific data point, finding, or policy detail from the document that directly supports the message. You must include the citation `[ID__Section__Paragraph]` if it is present in the source text. This grounds your argument in fact.\n\n**Rule 4: Prioritize for Maximum Impact.**\n* From all the points you could make, select only the 3-5 most impactful arguments.\n* Your selection should be based on which points are most likely to persuade the **Target Audience**, as analyzed in Rule 1.1. Curation is essential.\n\n### **Output Formatting**\n\n* Use a main heading: **Talking Points: {viewpoint}**\n* Add a subheading to specify the audience: **Prepared for: {audience}**\n* Present the final output as a bulleted list.

No external information, assumptions, or interpretations are to be introduced.\n2.  **Attribution [id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]:** Whenever possible, provide general attribution by citing the page number(s) or specific section(s)/heading(s) of the report from which the information was extracted. This is especially critical for verbatim quotes and key analytical points. This general attribution is distinct from, and should be provided in addition to, any specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` markers captured under Rule 7.\n3.  **Verbatim Quotes:**\n    * Rule 3.1: Use verbatim quotes when the report presents official statements, policy declarations, definitions of key terms, or when the precise wording is essential for conveying meaning or nuance.\n    * Rule 3.2: Enclose all verbatim quotes in quotation marks (\" \").\n    * Rule 3.3: If a quote is lengthy and a concise summary can accurately capture its essence for a particular field, a summary may be used, but the option to include the full quote (perhaps in an appendix or a supplementary note field if we add one later) should be considered. The primary field should prioritize conciseness if a summary is adequate.\n4.  **Paraphrased Summaries:**\n    * Rule 4.1: Use paraphrased summaries for explaining complex concepts, synthesizing information from multiple parts of the report, or when the original text is too lengthy for the field's purpose.\n    * Rule 4.2: Summaries must accurately reflect the source material's meaning, including any stated assumptions or conclusions presented in the report related to the summarized point.\n    * Rule 4.3: Maintain neutral language. Avoid loaded terms or phrasing that introduces bias not present in the source.\n    * Rule 4.4: Strive for conciseness while ensuring completeness of the relevant information for that field.\n5.  **\"Not Specified in Report\":** If, after a thorough review, the information required for a field cannot be found in the report, enter \"Not Specified in Report.\" Do not leave fields blank.\n6.  **Consistency:** Apply heuristics and rules consistently across all reports analyzed.\n7.  **Handling Specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` Citation Pattern:**\n    * Rule 7.1: While processing the source document text, be vigilant for citation markers matching the **exact alphanumeric pattern**: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n        * `id_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for the document.\n        * `section_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a section.\n        * `subsection_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a subsection.\n        * Double underscores (`__`) separate `id_ref` from `section_ref`.\n        * Triple underscores (`___`) separate `section_ref` from `subsection_ref`.\n    * Rule 7.2: If such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is identified *within the text segment being extracted* (either for a verbatim quote or as the basis for a summary) AND this pattern is used by the source document to refer to its own sections/subsections or those of closely related internal documents explicitly part of the same corpus:\n        * Rule 7.2.1: If the extraction is a verbatim quote, this `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern, if present in the quoted material, must be included as part of the quote.\n        * Rule 7.2.2: When such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is present in the text segment being extracted (whether quoted or summarized), this specific marker string (e.g., `[doc001__sec02___subA]`) MUST be preserved and included as part of the output for the relevant field.\n            * *Example:* If the extracted content for a field is 'The program funding was increased by 10%.' (attributed to 'p. 15, Budget Allocation Section' per Rule 2), and the original source text for this statement also contained the marker `[report42__budget01___increaseA]`, then the final entry for that field should be: 'The program funding was increased by 10%. `[report42__budget01___increaseA]`'.\n    * Rule 7.3: This rule (Rule 7) details how to handle the specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker when found in the source text. The general page/section attribution from Rule 2 (e.g. page number or general section heading) should ideally still be noted by the analyst for traceability, even if the final output format for the field emphasizes the `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker as shown in the Rule 7.2.2 example.\n    * Rule 7.4: Only the exact `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is to be considered a valid citation marker for capture under this Rule 7. Other citation forms, such as numerical footnote markers (e.g., \"\\[1\\]\", \"\\[23\\]\"), author-date citations (e.g., \"(Smith, 2020)\"), or textual references like \"see the section on X,\" are **not** to be captured or treated under this Rule 7. Such other citation forms may be part of a verbatim quote if they fall within the quoted text but should not be separately extracted or appended as if they were a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker.\n8. **Citation Requirements:**\n    * Every statement you write that is extracted from the text must be cited back to the general citation format that is in the document: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n    * Never provide a statement that does not have this citation because it is critical to validating the information in the report. If a specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is not present for a piece of information, use the general page/section attribution from Rule 2. The ideal is to have the specific marker; if absent, general attribution is the minimum.\n\n---\n\n**1.

No external information, assumptions, or interpretations are to be introduced.\n2.  **Attribution [id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]:** Whenever possible, provide general attribution by citing the page number(s) or specific section(s)/heading(s) of the report from which the information was extracted. This is especially critical for verbatim quotes and key analytical points. This general attribution is distinct from, and should be provided in addition to, any specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` markers captured under Rule 7.\n3.  **Verbatim Quotes:**\n    * Rule 3.1: Use verbatim quotes when the report presents official statements, policy declarations, definitions of key terms, or when the precise wording is essential for conveying meaning or nuance.\n    * Rule 3.2: Enclose all verbatim quotes in quotation marks (\" \").\n    * Rule 3.3: If a quote is lengthy and a concise summary can accurately capture its essence for a particular field, a summary may be used, but the option to include the full quote (perhaps in an appendix or a supplementary note field if we add one later) should be considered. The primary field should prioritize conciseness if a summary is adequate.\n4.  **Paraphrased Summaries:**\n    * Rule 4.1: Use paraphrased summaries for explaining complex concepts, synthesizing information from multiple parts of the report, or when the original text is too lengthy for the field's purpose.\n    * Rule 4.2: Summaries must accurately reflect the source material's meaning, including any stated assumptions or conclusions presented in the report related to the summarized point.\n    * Rule 4.3: Maintain neutral language. Avoid loaded terms or phrasing that introduces bias not present in the source.\n    * Rule 4.4: Strive for conciseness while ensuring completeness of the relevant information for that field.\n5.  **\"Not Specified in Report\":** If, after a thorough review, the information required for a field cannot be found in the report, enter \"Not Specified in Report.\" Do not leave fields blank.\n6.  **Consistency:** Apply heuristics and rules consistently across all reports analyzed.\n7.  **Handling Specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` Citation Pattern:**\n    * Rule 7.1: While processing the source document text, be vigilant for citation markers matching the **exact alphanumeric pattern**: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n        * `id_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for the document.\n        * `section_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a section.\n        * `subsection_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a subsection.\n        * Double underscores (`__`) separate `id_ref` from `section_ref`.\n        * Triple underscores (`___`) separate `section_ref` from `subsection_ref`.\n    * Rule 7.2: If such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is identified *within the text segment being extracted* (either for a verbatim quote or as the basis for a summary) AND this pattern is used by the source document to refer to its own sections/subsections or those of closely related internal documents explicitly part of the same corpus:\n        * Rule 7.2.1: If the extraction is a verbatim quote, this `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern, if present in the quoted material, must be included as part of the quote.\n        * Rule 7.2.2: When such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is present in the text segment being extracted (whether quoted or summarized), this specific marker string (e.g., `[doc001__sec02___subA]`) MUST be preserved and included as part of the output for the relevant field. It should be presented alongside the general attribution from Rule 2.\n            * *Example:* If the extracted content for a field is 'The initiative was deemed successful.' (attributed to 'p. 15, Evaluation Section' per Rule 2), and the original source text for this statement also contained the marker `[report42__eval01___successA]`, then the final entry for that field should be: '`[report42__eval01___successA]`'.\n    * Rule 7.3: This rule (Rule 7) details how to handle the specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker when found in the source text. The general page/section attribution from Rule 2 must still be provided for all extracted information.\n    * Rule 7.4: Only the exact `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is to be considered a valid citation marker for capture under this Rule 7. Other citation forms, such as numerical footnote markers (e.g., \"\\[1\\]\", \"\\[23\\]\"), author-date citations (e.g., \"(Smith, 2020)\"), or textual references like \"see the section on X,\" are **not** to be captured or treated under this Rule 7. Such other citation forms may be part of a verbatim quote if they fall within the quoted text but should not be separately extracted or appended as if they were a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker.\n8. **Citation Requirements:**\n    * Every statement you write that is extracted from the text must be cited back to the general citation format that is in the document: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n    * Never provide a statement that does not have this citation because it is critical to validating the information in the report.\n\n---\n\n**1.

This includes rationale, assumptions, intended and unintended consequences, implementation challenges, and a balanced view of pros and cons.\n\n**General Rules for Information Extraction (Applicable to all fields unless overridden by specific field rules):**\n\n1.  **Source Adherence:** All extracted information must originate directly from the provided report. No external information, assumptions, or interpretations are to be introduced.\n2.  **Attribution [id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]:** Whenever possible, provide general attribution by citing the page number(s) or specific section(s)/heading(s) of the report from which the information was extracted. This is especially critical for verbatim quotes and key analytical points. This general attribution is distinct from, and should be provided in addition to, any specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` markers captured under Rule 7.\n3.  **Verbatim Quotes:**\n    * Rule 3.1: Use verbatim quotes when the report presents official statements, policy declarations, definitions of key terms, or when the precise wording is essential for conveying meaning or nuance.\n    * Rule 3.2: Enclose all verbatim quotes in quotation marks (\" \").\n    * Rule 3.3: If a quote is lengthy and a concise summary can accurately capture its essence for a particular field, a summary may be used. The primary field should prioritize conciseness if a summary is adequate.\n4.  **Paraphrased Summaries:**\n    * Rule 4.1: Use paraphrased summaries for explaining complex concepts, synthesizing information from multiple parts of the report, or when the original text is too lengthy for the field's purpose.\n    * Rule 4.2: Summaries must accurately reflect the source material's meaning, including any stated assumptions or conclusions presented in the report related to the summarized point.\n    * Rule 4.3: Maintain neutral language. Avoid loaded terms or phrasing that introduces bias not present in the source.\n    * Rule 4.4: Strive for conciseness while ensuring completeness of the relevant information for that field.\n5.  **\"Not Specified in Report\":** If, after a thorough review, the information required for a field cannot be found in the report, enter \"Not Specified in Report.\" Do not leave fields blank. If a section asks for both \"Pros\" and \"Cons\" (or similar contrasting aspects) and the report only details one, state \"Not Specified in Report\" for the missing aspect.\n6.  **Consistency:** Apply heuristics and rules consistently across all reports analyzed.\n7.  **Handling Specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` Citation Pattern:**\n    * Rule 7.1: While processing the source document text, be vigilant for citation markers matching the **exact alphanumeric pattern**: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n        * `id_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for the document.\n        * `section_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a section.\n        * `subsection_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a subsection.\n        * Double underscores (`__`) separate `id_ref` from `section_ref`.\n        * Triple underscores (`___`) separate `section_ref` from `subsection_ref`.\n    * Rule 7.2: If such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is identified *within the text segment being extracted* (either for a verbatim quote or as the basis for a summary) AND this pattern is used by the source document to refer to its own sections/subsections or those of closely related internal documents explicitly part of the same corpus:\n        * Rule 7.2.1: If the extraction is a verbatim quote, this `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern, if present in the quoted material, must be included as part of the quote.\n        * Rule 7.2.2: When such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is present in the text segment being extracted (whether quoted or summarized), this specific marker string (e.g., `[doc001__sec02___subA]`) MUST be preserved and included as part of the output for the relevant field.\n            * *Example:* If the extracted content for a field is 'The policy led to a 5% increase in employment.' (attributed to 'p. 15, Economic Impact Section' per Rule 2), and the original source text for this statement also contained the marker `[report42__econImpact01___emplA]`, then the final entry for that field should be: 'The policy led to a 5% increase in employment. `[report42__econImpact01___emplA]`'.\n    * Rule 7.3: This rule (Rule 7) details how to handle the specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker when found in the source text. The general page/section attribution from Rule 2 (e.g. page number or general section heading) should ideally still be noted by the analyst for traceability, even if the final output format for the field emphasizes the `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker as shown in the Rule 7.2.2 example.\n    * Rule 7.4: Only the exact `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is to be considered a valid citation marker for capture under this Rule 7. Other citation forms, such as numerical footnote markers (e.g., \"\\[1\\]\", \"\\[23\\]\"), author-date citations (e.g., \"(Smith, 2020)\"), or textual references like \"see the section on X,\" are **not** to be captured or treated under this Rule 7. Such other citation forms may be part of a verbatim quote if they fall within the quoted text but should not be separately extracted or appended as if they were a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker.\n8. **Citation Requirements:**\n    * Every statement you write that is extracted from the text must be cited back to the general citation format that is in the document: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n    * Never provide a statement that does not have this citation because it is critical to validating the information in the report. If a specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is not present for a piece of information, use the general page/section attribution from Rule 2. The ideal is to have the specific marker; if absent, general attribution is the minimum.\n\n---\n\n**1.
