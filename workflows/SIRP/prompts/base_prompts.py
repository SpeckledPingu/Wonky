**Instructions & Rules for Brainstorming Questions:**
1.  **Relevance:** Questions must directly relate to the objective and focus.
2.  **Specificity:** Questions should be specific enough to guide research (avoid overly broad questions).
3.  **Answerability:** Questions should be potentially answerable through research (avoid purely speculative questions).
4.  **Categorization:** Consider questions related to different facets mentioned in the objective/focus (e.g., specific productivity metrics, different well-being aspects).

1.  **Strict Relevance:** Extract information *only* if it directly and substantively addresses the specified 'Research Question/Information Need Context'. Discard marginally relevant or background information.
2.  **Extract Facts/Data/Quotes:** Focus on extracting specific, verifiable facts, quantitative data points, key findings reported by the source, or direct, concise quotes that capture a crucial point.
3.  **Objectivity & Accuracy:** Extract information exactly as presented. Do *not* paraphrase in a way that changes meaning. Do *not* insert external knowledge or analyst interpretation. Ensure accuracy if transcribing quotes or data.
4.  **Attribute Clearly:** If the source attributes a finding to a specific study or entity mentioned within the chunk, include that attribution.
5.  **Handle Multiple Points:** List distinct relevant points separately (e.g., using bullet points).
6.  **Explicit 'No Info' Handling:** If *no* information meeting the above criteria is found, state *exactly*: "No specific relevant information found in this chunk addressing the research context."

**Instructions & Rules for Analysis & Synthesis:**
1.  **Address Question Directly:** Your entire analysis must focus on answering Research Question Q1 using *only* the provided information points.
2.  **Integrate Source Assessment:** Explicitly reference the 'Source Assessment & Analyst Notes' for Info IDs (I##) when discussing their contribution. Explain *how* the assessment (e.g., bias, reliability, subjectivity) affects the weight or interpretation of that information in your analysis. Down-weight information assessed as weak or biased.
3.  **Identify Specific Patterns:** Analyze the relationships between information points. Explicitly identify and describe:
    * **Confirmations:** Where different sources/data points support the same finding.
    * **Contradictions:** Where sources/data points disagree. Analyze potential reasons for contradiction based on source assessments.
    * **Trends/Nuances:** Patterns emerging from the data (e.g., consistent finding across different contexts, differing results based on methodology).
4.  **Formulate Analytical Points (A##):** Synthesize findings into distinct, concise analytical points (label sequentially starting A{a_id_counter}). Each A## should represent a significant conclusion *derived from the analysis*, not just a summary of one piece of info.
5.  **Mandatory Citation:** *Every* substantive claim, finding, or interpretation within each Analysis Point (A##) *must* be followed immediately by citation of the supporting Info ID(s) in parentheses, like this: (I01, I03). Claims without direct citation to the provided I## are not allowed.
6.  **Acknowledge Internal Limitations:** Explicitly mention limitations *arising directly from the provided information itself* â€“ e.g., "Conflicting findings between I01 (high credibility) and I05 (lower credibility) create uncertainty," or "Lack of quantitative data on [specific aspect] prevents a firm conclusion here."
7.  **Output Structure:** Organize the output clearly under the heading "Analysis & Synthesis for Question [Q1]:". Ensure Analysis Points (A##) are distinct and citations (I##) are correctly placed.
