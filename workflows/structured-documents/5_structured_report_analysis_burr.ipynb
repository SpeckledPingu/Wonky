    "## Foreign Policy Overview - Structured Document Template\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To capture essential foreign policy information from a CRS report in a structured format, using a combination of verbatim quotes and concise, rule-based summaries, allowing for analysis of multiple geopolitical actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Rules for Information Extraction (Applicable to all fields unless overridden by specific field rules):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Source Adherence:** All extracted information must originate directly from the provided CRS report. No external information, assumptions, or interpretations are to be introduced.\n",
    "2.  **Attribution [id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]:** Whenever possible, provide general attribution by citing the page number(s) or specific section(s)/heading(s) of the report from which the information was extracted. This is especially critical for verbatim quotes and key analytical points. This general attribution is distinct from, and should be provided in addition to, any specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` markers captured under Rule 7.\n",
    "3.  **Verbatim Quotes:**\n",
    "    * Rule 3.1: Use verbatim quotes when the report presents official statements, policy declarations, definitions of key terms, or when the precise wording is essential for conveying meaning or nuance.\n",
    "    * Rule 3.2: Enclose all verbatim quotes in quotation marks (\" \").\n",
    "    * Rule 3.3: If a quote is lengthy and a concise summary can accurately capture its essence for a particular field, a summary may be used, but the option to include the full quote (perhaps in an appendix or a supplementary note field if we add one later) should be considered. The primary field should prioritize conciseness if a summary is adequate.\n",
    "4.  **Paraphrased Summaries:**\n",
    "    * Rule 4.1: Use paraphrased summaries for explaining complex concepts, synthesizing information from multiple parts of the report, or when the original text is too lengthy for the field's purpose.\n",
    "    * Rule 4.2: Summaries must accurately reflect the source material's meaning, including any stated assumptions or conclusions presented in the report related to the summarized point.\n",
    "    * Rule 4.3: Maintain neutral language. Avoid loaded terms or phrasing that introduces bias not present in the source.\n",
    "    * Rule 4.4: Strive for conciseness while ensuring completeness of the relevant information for that field.\n",
    "5.  **\"Not Specified in Report\":** If, after a thorough review, the information required for a field cannot be found in the report, enter \"Not Specified in Report.\" Do not leave fields blank.\n",
    "6.  **Consistency:** Apply heuristics and rules consistently across all reports analyzed.\n",
    "7.  **Handling Specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` Citation Pattern:**\n",
    "    * Rule 7.1: While processing the source document text, be vigilant for citation markers matching the **exact alphanumeric pattern**: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n",
    "        * `id_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for the document.\n",
    "        * `section_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a section.\n",
    "        * `subsection_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a subsection.\n",
    "        * Double underscores (`__`) separate `id_ref` from `section_ref`.\n",
    "        * Triple underscores (`___`) separate `section_ref` from `subsection_ref`.\n",
    "    * Rule 7.2: If such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is identified *within the text segment being extracted* (either for a verbatim quote or as the basis for a summary) AND this pattern is used by the source document to refer to its own sections/subsections or those of closely related internal documents explicitly part of the same corpus:\n",
    "        * Rule 7.2.1: If the extraction is a verbatim quote, this `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern, if present in the quoted material, must be included as part of the quote.\n",
    "        * Rule 7.2.2: When such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is present in the text segment being extracted (whether quoted or summarized), this specific marker string (e.g., `[doc001__sec02___subA]`) MUST be preserved and included as part of the output for the relevant field. It should be presented alongside the general attribution from Rule 2.\n",
    "            * *Example:* If the extracted content for a field is 'The initiative was deemed successful.' (attributed to 'p. 15, Evaluation Section' per Rule 2), and the original source text for this statement also contained the marker `[report42__eval01___successA]`, then the final entry for that field should be: '`[report42__eval01___successA]`'.\n",
    "    * Rule 7.3: This rule (Rule 7) details how to handle the specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker when found in the source text. The general page/section attribution from Rule 2 must still be provided for all extracted information.\n",
    "    * Rule 7.4: Only the exact `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is to be considered a valid citation marker for capture under this Rule 7. Other citation forms, such as numerical footnote markers (e.g., \"\\\\[1\\\\]\", \"\\\\[23\\\\]\"), author-date citations (e.g., \"(Smith, 2020)\"), or textual references like \"see the section on X,\" are **not** to be captured or treated under this Rule 7. Such other citation forms may be part of a verbatim quote if they fall within the quoted text but should not be separately extracted or appended as if they were a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker.\n",
    "8. **Citation Requirements:**\n",
    "    * Every statement you write that is extracted from the text must be cited back to the general citation format that is in the document: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n",
    "    * Never provide a statement that does not have this citation because it is critical to validating the information in the report.\n",

    "**Objective:** To capture essential domestic policy information from an analytical report in a structured format, using a combination of verbatim quotes and concise, rule-based summaries, allowing for analysis of policies within any given domestic jurisdiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Rules for Information Extraction (Applicable to all fields unless overridden by specific field rules):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Source Adherence:** All extracted information must originate directly from the provided report. No external information, assumptions, or interpretations are to be introduced.\n",
    "2.  **Attribution [id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]:** Whenever possible, provide general attribution by citing the page number(s) or specific section(s)/heading(s) of the report from which the information was extracted. This is especially critical for verbatim quotes and key analytical points. This general attribution is distinct from, and should be provided in addition to, any specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` markers captured under Rule 7.\n",
    "3.  **Verbatim Quotes:**\n",
    "    * Rule 3.1: Use verbatim quotes when the report presents official statements, policy declarations, definitions of key terms, or when the precise wording is essential for conveying meaning or nuance.\n",
    "    * Rule 3.2: Enclose all verbatim quotes in quotation marks (\" \").\n",
    "    * Rule 3.3: If a quote is lengthy and a concise summary can accurately capture its essence for a particular field, a summary may be used, but the option to include the full quote (perhaps in an appendix or a supplementary note field if we add one later) should be considered. The primary field should prioritize conciseness if a summary is adequate.\n",
    "4.  **Paraphrased Summaries:**\n",
    "    * Rule 4.1: Use paraphrased summaries for explaining complex concepts, synthesizing information from multiple parts of the report, or when the original text is too lengthy for the field's purpose.\n",
    "    * Rule 4.2: Summaries must accurately reflect the source material's meaning, including any stated assumptions or conclusions presented in the report related to the summarized point.\n",
    "    * Rule 4.3: Maintain neutral language. Avoid loaded terms or phrasing that introduces bias not present in the source.\n",
    "    * Rule 4.4: Strive for conciseness while ensuring completeness of the relevant information for that field.\n",
    "5.  **\"Not Specified in Report\":** If, after a thorough review, the information required for a field cannot be found in the report, enter \"Not Specified in Report.\" Do not leave fields blank.\n",
    "6.  **Consistency:** Apply heuristics and rules consistently across all reports analyzed.\n",
    "7.  **Handling Specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` Citation Pattern:**\n",
    "    * Rule 7.1: While processing the source document text, be vigilant for citation markers matching the **exact alphanumeric pattern**: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n",
    "        * `id_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for the document.\n",
    "        * `section_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a section.\n",
    "        * `subsection_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a subsection.\n",
    "        * Double underscores (`__`) separate `id_ref` from `section_ref`.\n",
    "        * Triple underscores (`___`) separate `section_ref` from `subsection_ref`.\n",
    "    * Rule 7.2: If such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is identified *within the text segment being extracted* (either for a verbatim quote or as the basis for a summary) AND this pattern is used by the source document to refer to its own sections/subsections or those of closely related internal documents explicitly part of the same corpus:\n",
    "        * Rule 7.2.1: If the extraction is a verbatim quote, this `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern, if present in the quoted material, must be included as part of the quote.\n",
    "        * Rule 7.2.2: When such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is present in the text segment being extracted (whether quoted or summarized), this specific marker string (e.g., `[doc001__sec02___subA]`) MUST be preserved and included as part of the output for the relevant field.\n",
    "            * *Example:* If the extracted content for a field is 'The program funding was increased by 10%.' (attributed to 'p. 15, Budget Allocation Section' per Rule 2), and the original source text for this statement also contained the marker `[report42__budget01___increaseA]`, then the final entry for that field should be: 'The program funding was increased by 10%. `[report42__budget01___increaseA]`'.\n",
    "    * Rule 7.3: This rule (Rule 7) details how to handle the specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker when found in the source text. The general page/section attribution from Rule 2 (e.g. page number or general section heading) should ideally still be noted by the analyst for traceability, even if the final output format for the field emphasizes the `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker as shown in the Rule 7.2.2 example.\n",
    "    * Rule 7.4: Only the exact `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is to be considered a valid citation marker for capture under this Rule 7. Other citation forms, such as numerical footnote markers (e.g., \"\\\\[1\\\\]\", \"\\\\[23\\\\]\"), author-date citations (e.g., \"(Smith, 2020)\"), or textual references like \"see the section on X,\" are **not** to be captured or treated under this Rule 7. Such other citation forms may be part of a verbatim quote if they fall within the quoted text but should not be separately extracted or appended as if they were a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker.\n",
    "8. **Citation Requirements:**\n",
    "    * Every statement you write that is extracted from the text must be cited back to the general citation format that is in the document: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n",
    "    * Never provide a statement that does not have this citation because it is critical to validating the information in the report. If a specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is not present for a piece of information, use the general page/section attribution from Rule 2. The ideal is to have the specific marker; if absent, general attribution is the minimum.\n",

    "## Policy Impact Overview - Structured Document Template\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To capture essential information regarding the impact (actual or potential) of a specific policy from an analytical report in a structured format. This includes rationale, assumptions, intended and unintended consequences, implementation challenges, and a balanced view of pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Rules for Information Extraction (Applicable to all fields unless overridden by specific field rules):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Source Adherence:** All extracted information must originate directly from the provided report. No external information, assumptions, or interpretations are to be introduced.\n",
    "2.  **Attribution [id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]:** Whenever possible, provide general attribution by citing the page number(s) or specific section(s)/heading(s) of the report from which the information was extracted. This is especially critical for verbatim quotes and key analytical points. This general attribution is distinct from, and should be provided in addition to, any specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` markers captured under Rule 7.\n",
    "3.  **Verbatim Quotes:**\n",
    "    * Rule 3.1: Use verbatim quotes when the report presents official statements, policy declarations, definitions of key terms, or when the precise wording is essential for conveying meaning or nuance.\n",
    "    * Rule 3.2: Enclose all verbatim quotes in quotation marks (\" \").\n",
    "    * Rule 3.3: If a quote is lengthy and a concise summary can accurately capture its essence for a particular field, a summary may be used. The primary field should prioritize conciseness if a summary is adequate.\n",
    "4.  **Paraphrased Summaries:**\n",
    "    * Rule 4.1: Use paraphrased summaries for explaining complex concepts, synthesizing information from multiple parts of the report, or when the original text is too lengthy for the field's purpose.\n",
    "    * Rule 4.2: Summaries must accurately reflect the source material's meaning, including any stated assumptions or conclusions presented in the report related to the summarized point.\n",
    "    * Rule 4.3: Maintain neutral language. Avoid loaded terms or phrasing that introduces bias not present in the source.\n",
    "    * Rule 4.4: Strive for conciseness while ensuring completeness of the relevant information for that field.\n",
    "5.  **\"Not Specified in Report\":** If, after a thorough review, the information required for a field cannot be found in the report, enter \"Not Specified in Report.\" Do not leave fields blank. If a section asks for both \"Pros\" and \"Cons\" (or similar contrasting aspects) and the report only details one, state \"Not Specified in Report\" for the missing aspect.\n",
    "6.  **Consistency:** Apply heuristics and rules consistently across all reports analyzed.\n",
    "7.  **Handling Specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` Citation Pattern:**\n",
    "    * Rule 7.1: While processing the source document text, be vigilant for citation markers matching the **exact alphanumeric pattern**: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n",
    "        * `id_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for the document.\n",
    "        * `section_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a section.\n",
    "        * `subsection_ref` will be an alphanumeric identifier for a subsection.\n",
    "        * Double underscores (`__`) separate `id_ref` from `section_ref`.\n",
    "        * Triple underscores (`___`) separate `section_ref` from `subsection_ref`.\n",
    "    * Rule 7.2: If such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is identified *within the text segment being extracted* (either for a verbatim quote or as the basis for a summary) AND this pattern is used by the source document to refer to its own sections/subsections or those of closely related internal documents explicitly part of the same corpus:\n",
    "        * Rule 7.2.1: If the extraction is a verbatim quote, this `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern, if present in the quoted material, must be included as part of the quote.\n",
    "        * Rule 7.2.2: When such a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is present in the text segment being extracted (whether quoted or summarized), this specific marker string (e.g., `[doc001__sec02___subA]`) MUST be preserved and included as part of the output for the relevant field.\n",
    "            * *Example:* If the extracted content for a field is 'The policy led to a 5% increase in employment.' (attributed to 'p. 15, Economic Impact Section' per Rule 2), and the original source text for this statement also contained the marker `[report42__econImpact01___emplA]`, then the final entry for that field should be: 'The policy led to a 5% increase in employment. `[report42__econImpact01___emplA]`'.\n",
    "    * Rule 7.3: This rule (Rule 7) details how to handle the specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker when found in the source text. The general page/section attribution from Rule 2 (e.g. page number or general section heading) should ideally still be noted by the analyst for traceability, even if the final output format for the field emphasizes the `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker as shown in the Rule 7.2.2 example.\n",
    "    * Rule 7.4: Only the exact `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` pattern is to be considered a valid citation marker for capture under this Rule 7. Other citation forms, such as numerical footnote markers (e.g., \"\\\\[1\\\\]\", \"\\\\[23\\\\]\"), author-date citations (e.g., \"(Smith, 2020)\"), or textual references like \"see the section on X,\" are **not** to be captured or treated under this Rule 7. Such other citation forms may be part of a verbatim quote if they fall within the quoted text but should not be separately extracted or appended as if they were a `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker.\n",
    "8. **Citation Requirements:**\n",
    "    * Every statement you write that is extracted from the text must be cited back to the general citation format that is in the document: `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]`.\n",
    "    * Never provide a statement that does not have this citation because it is critical to validating the information in the report. If a specific `[id_ref__section_ref___subsection_ref]` marker is not present for a piece of information, use the general page/section attribution from Rule 2. The ideal is to have the specific marker; if absent, general attribution is the minimum.\n",
