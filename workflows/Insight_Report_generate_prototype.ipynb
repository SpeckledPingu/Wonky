    "This template is your primary tool for breaking down dense research documents (like academic papers or long reports) into small, manageable, and analyzable pieces. A single report can contain dozens of important claims or \"insights.\" Your job is to capture the details about this insight: \"{insight}\"; so we can evaluate its strengths and weaknesses on its own merits. **Only fill out this template for the desired insight. If there is not enough information\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 1: Source and Context**\n",
    "*This section is for basic documentation. It is critical for ensuring we can always trace an insight back to its original source.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Original Source Title:** Copy and paste the full title of the article or report.\n",
    "* **Author(s) / Organization:** List the names of the individual authors or the name of the publishing organization (e.g., \"RAND Corporation\").\n",
    "* **Location in Source:** Be as specific as possible. This is crucial for allowing a senior analyst to quickly find the part of the document you are analyzing. The citation of this is in brackets in this format: [ABCD####__###___###]\n",
    "\n",
    "! Important: Only use citations that are found in brackets similar to the one I supplied. Do not use references to laws, papers, or other documents. Only use the document's citations when identifying the Location in Source !\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: The Core Insight**\n",
    "*This section defines the specific unit of analysis for this report. It is the most important section to get right.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Statement of the Insight:** Your goal is to summarize the core claim in a single, powerful sentence. Think of it as a newspaper headline for the insight. It should be a clear, declarative statement.\n",
    "    * *Example:* \"The author claims that state-funded job training programs reduce youth unemployment by an average of 15% within two years.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Comprehensive Explanation of the Insight:** This is where you provide the necessary nuance, quotes, and description that doesn't fit in the single-sentence statement. In a paragraph, explain the context around the insight. What makes it important? What is the author's angle? Does it challenge a conventional view? What are the specific quotes from the text that are highly relevant.\n",
    "    * *Example:* \"X found that Y is significant because it directly contradicts previous studies that found no effect. The argument being that the positive result is due to the inclusion of 'soft skills' training alongside technical skills, a component missing from earlier programs that were evaluated...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3: Deconstruction of the Argument**\n",
    "*In this section, you are a neutral reporter. Your job is to objectively extract what the author presented, without yet adding your own critique or analysis. You are simply reporting the facts of their argument.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Evidence FOR this Insight:** This is where you list the building blocks of the author's argument. Be exhaustive and precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **For each Evidence Point:**\n",
    "        * **Description:** Briefly label the type of evidence. Examples: \"Statistical analysis of survey data,\" \"Direct quote from a stakeholder interview,\" \"Case study results from the City X pilot program,\" \"Finding from a literature review.\"\n",

    "### **Overall Purpose**\n",
    "This template is your primary tool for breaking down dense research documents (like academic papers or long reports) into small, manageable, and analyzable pieces. A single report can contain dozens of important claims or \"insights.\" Your job is to capture the details about this list of insights so we can evaluate its strengths and weaknesses on its own merits. **Only fill out this template for the desired insights.**\n",
    "Do not introduce your response or conclude it. Only provide the filled out insights. If there is no information provided for a field, then just reply \"N/A\". Don't comment any further.\n",

    "*This section is for basic documentation. It is critical for ensuring we can always trace an insight back to its original source.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Original Source Title:** Copy and paste the full title of the article or report.\n",
    "* **Author(s) / Organization:** List the names of the individual authors or the name of the publishing organization (e.g., \"RAND Corporation\").\n",
    "* **Location in Source:** Be as specific as possible. This is crucial for allowing a senior analyst to quickly find the part of the document you are analyzing. The citation of this is in brackets in this format: [ABCD####__###___###]\n",

    "*This section defines the specific unit of analysis for this report. It is the most important section to get right.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Statement of the Insight:** Your goal is to summarize the core claim in a single, powerful sentence. Think of it as a newspaper headline for the insight. It should be a clear, declarative statement.\n",
    "    * *Example:* \"The author claims that state-funded job training programs reduce youth unemployment by an average of 15% within two years.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Comprehensive Explanation of the Insight:** This is where you provide the necessary nuance, quotes, and description that doesn't fit in the single-sentence statement. In a paragraph, explain the context around the insight. What makes it important? What is the author's angle? Does it challenge a conventional view? What are the specific quotes from the text that are highly relevant. Do not say that the insight shows, or says, provide the text and evidence that is in the text that *shows* the core insight.\n",
    "    * *Example:* \"X found that Y is significant because it directly contradicts previous studies that found no effect. The argument being that the positive result is due to the inclusion of 'soft skills' training alongside technical skills, a component missing from earlier programs that were evaluated...\"\n",
