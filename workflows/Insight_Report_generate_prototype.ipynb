    "This template is your primary tool for breaking down dense research documents (like academic papers or long reports) into small, manageable, and analyzable pieces. A single report can contain dozens of important claims or \"insights.\" Your job is to capture the details about this insight: \"{insight}\"; so we can evaluate its strengths and weaknesses on its own merits. **Only fill out this template for the desired insight. If there is not enough information\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Original Source Title:** Copy and paste the full title of the article or report.\n",
    "* **Author(s) / Organization:** List the names of the individual authors or the name of the publishing organization (e.g., \"RAND Corporation\").\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: The Core Insight**\n",
    "*This section defines the specific unit of analysis for this report. It is the most important section to get right.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Statement of the Insight:** Your goal is to summarize the core claim in a single, powerful sentence. Think of it as a newspaper headline for the insight. It should be a clear, declarative statement.\n",
    "    * *Example:* \"The author claims that state-funded job training programs reduce youth unemployment by an average of 15% within two years.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Comprehensive Explanation of the Insight:** This is where you provide the necessary nuance, quotes, and description that doesn't fit in the single-sentence statement. In a paragraph, explain the context around the insight. What makes it important? What is the author's angle? Does it challenge a conventional view? What are the specific quotes from the text that are highly relevant.\n",

    "        * **Source Note:** This is very important for understanding the foundation of the author's argument. Identify the specific source the author references to support this evidence point. The source text will often contain citations like \"(Smith, 2022)\" or mention \"a report from the RAND Corporation.\" Note that citation here exactly as the author presents it. Example: \"The author cites Smith (2022) for this data point.\"\n",

If the author *didn't* mention any counter-evidence but you know it exists or see a clear gap, you can note that here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Author's Reasoning AGAINST this Insight (or for the Nuance):** If the author did present counter-evidence, how did they explain it? Did they dismiss it? Did they say it only applies in certain contexts? This reveals a lot about the author's perspective.\n",

      "Rural broadband in the United States faces a unique set of challenges stemming from its inherent geographic and demographic characteristics. The low population density in rural areas translates to a higher cost per subscriber for infrastructure deployment. Laying fiber optic cables or installing wireless towers across vast distances with few potential customers makes the return on investment significantly less attractive for private internet service providers (ISPs). This economic disincentive is further compounded by the often rugged terrain and environmental factors, such as dense forests or mountainous regions, which increase construction and maintenance expenses. Consequently, many rural communities are left with outdated infrastructure, limited bandwidth options, and significantly higher prices compared to their urban counterparts, creating a digital divide that hinders economic development and social equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most significant barriers to improved rural broadband access is the complex and often fragmented funding landscape. While various federal and state programs exist to subsidize infrastructure development and service provision, navigating the application process can be daunting for smaller, local ISPs or community organizations. These programs often have stringent requirements, lengthy approval timelines, and complex reporting obligations, which can be particularly burdensome for entities with limited administrative capacity. Furthermore, the allocation of funds can be influenced by political considerations and lobbying efforts, potentially diverting resources away from the areas with the greatest need. Streamlining the funding process, providing technical assistance to applicants, and ensuring transparency in allocation decisions are crucial steps towards overcoming this barrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the challenges, significant opportunities exist to improve rural broadband access through innovative technologies and collaborative partnerships. Wireless technologies, such as fixed wireless access (FWA) and satellite internet, offer viable alternatives to traditional wired infrastructure in areas where fiber deployment is prohibitively expensive. These technologies can be deployed more quickly and cost-effectively, providing immediate connectivity to underserved communities. Furthermore, public-private partnerships, involving local governments, community anchor institutions (schools, libraries, hospitals), and private ISPs, can leverage shared resources and expertise to develop sustainable broadband solutions. These partnerships can also explore innovative financing models, such as community broadband networks, where local residents and businesses invest in and own the infrastructure, ensuring long-term control and affordability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond infrastructure deployment, addressing the digital literacy gap and promoting broadband adoption are essential for maximizing the benefits of improved access. Simply providing internet connectivity is not enough; residents must also have the skills and knowledge to effectively utilize online resources for education, healthcare, employment, and civic engagement. Digital literacy training programs, tailored to the specific needs of rural communities, can empower individuals to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by broadband. Furthermore, affordability remains a significant barrier for many low-income households. Subsidized internet access programs, such as the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), can help bridge the affordability gap and ensure that all residents have the opportunity to participate in the digital economy.\n",

Some are specifically and exclusively designed to support broadband infrastructure deployment (e.g., Rural Broadband Loans, Community Connect grants, Broadband Initiatives Program), [5] while others (e.g., Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans) have historically supported infrastructure for telephone voice service, but have now evolved into support for broadband-capable service provided by traditional telephone borrowers.  [6] Additionally, other programs (e.g., Distance Learning and Telemedicine, Delta Health Services grants) support specific broadband-based applications.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n Table 1.

[R42524__6___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n## Definition of \"Rural\"\\\\n The rural nature of an area or community served by grant and loan projects is a key characteristic of RUS telecommunications programs.  One of the primary strategic goals of the USDA is to \"assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self-sustaining, repopulating, and economically thriving. \" [7] While many rural telecommunications providers already have deployed broadband networks, studies, surveys, and data collections continue to show that broadband access, on average, is less adequate in rural areas than it is in suburban or urban communities.  [8]\\\\n The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas.  Particularly for wireline broadband technologies—such as cable modem and DSL [9]—the greater the geographical distances among customers, the larger the cost to serve those customers. Thus, there is often less incentive for companies to invest in broadband in rural areas than, for example, in an urban area where there is more demand (more customers with perhaps higher incomes) and less cost to wire the market area.\\\\n Given the RUS emphasis on \"rural\" broadband, the issue becomes: what level of \"rurality\" is necessary for an area to be eligible for RUS broadband grants or loans?  Within the RUS telecommunications portfolio, there is no standard definition of \"rural,\" with programs such as the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee program defining eligible rural areas as populations less than 20,000 (plus areas not in an urbanized area adjacent to a city of not more than 50,000), while the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan program defines eligible areas as populations of 5,000 or less (extremely rural areas).  Among all the RUS telecommunications programs, the different definitions of eligible service areas (which correspond to definitions of rurality) are presented in .\\\\n Shifting definitions of \"rural\" have generated controversy.  For example, during the first round of BIP awards, a separate category called \"remote areas\" was created, defined as an unserved rural area at least 50 miles from the limits of a non-rural area.  For last mile projects, [10] only remote areas were eligible for BIP grants (as opposed to loans or grant/loan combinations).  The remote area category was eliminated in the second round, due to criticism from many Members of Congress who argued that the remote rural definition excluded many areas of the country (primarily in the eastern half of the United States).\\\\n The definition of \"rural\" has also generated much controversy over the Rural Broadband Loan and Loan Guarantee program, particularly as Congress continues to refine the program through periodic consideration of the farm bill.  [11] Over the life of the broadband loan program, the definition of a rural area eligible for the program has been changed three separate times by Congress. [12] Ultimately, the definition of what constitutes a rural community is always a difficult issue for congressional policymakers in determining how to target rural communities for broadband assistance.  On the one hand, the narrower the definition the greater the possibility that deserving communities may be excluded.  On the other hand, the broader the definition used, the greater the possibility that communities not typically considered \"rural\" or \"underserved\" may be eligible for financial assistance.\\\\n During the 113 \\\\\\\\[th\\\\\\\\] Congress, the 2013 farm bill—which would amend the statute authorizing the rural broadband loan and loan guarantee program—explicitly addresses the rural definition issue.  For example, [S. 954](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/z?d113:S.954:), the Senate-passed version of the farm bill (the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013), would adopt a uniform definition of \"rural area\" for *all* USDA rural development programs, including the broadband program.  Under the Senate bill, a rural area would be defined as any area that is not a city or town with a population greater than 50,000, and that is not an urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or town with a population over 50,000.  Because the current definition of a rural area eligible for broadband loans is towns with populations under 20,000, this new definition would increase the number of larger communities eligible for broadband assistance. [R42524__8___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n## Existing Providers\\\\n Because rural and sparsely populated areas typically offer providers less financial incentive to build broadband networks, it is generally the case that the more rural the area, the fewer the likely number of existing broadband providers.  By contrast, urban and suburban areas are more likely to have a greater number of existing broadband providers offering service.\\\\n One of the ongoing concerns expressed by some Members of Congress is the extent to which RUS grants and loans have been awarded to projects serving areas that already have existing providers offering broadband service.  [13] The issue of providing federal funding to areas and communities with existing providers is controversial, and has been previously raised with respect to the RUS Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program [14] and the Broadband Initiatives Program.  [15] Broadband awards to areas with preexisting service—that is, areas where existing companies already provide some level of broadband—have sparked controversy because award recipients might compete to some extent with other companies already providing broadband service.  On the one hand, one could argue that the federal government should not be subsidizing competitors for broadband service, particularly in sparsely populated rural markets which may be able only to support one provider.  Furthermore, providing grants and loans for projects serving communities with preexisting broadband service may divert assistance from unserved areas that are most in need.\\\\n On the other hand, many suburban and urban areas currently receive the benefits of competition among broadband providers—competition which can potentially drive down prices while improving service and performance. It is therefore appropriate, others have argued, that rural areas also receive the benefits of competition, which in some areas may not be possible without federal financial assistance.  It is also argued that it may not be economically feasible for applicants to serve sparsely populated unserved communities unless they are permitted to also serve more lucrative areas which may already have existing providers.\\\\n The existing provider issue was examined during congressional consideration of the 2012 farm bill.  The 2008 farm bill (which is the current statute in force) set specific restrictions on the broadband loan eligibility of project areas with existing providers.  However, RUS did not issue a rule reflecting those changes until March 2011. Organizations representing the cable industry have argued that existing provider restrictions should be strengthened to focus the loan program more exclusively on unserved areas with no existing providers.  By contrast, organizations representing rural telecommunications providers (primarily the traditional rural telephone companies) counter that no changes should be made to the existing provider restrictions, given that RUS has had limited opportunity to award new loans under the new 2008 farm bill rules.  In the 2013 farm bill, [S. 954](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/z?d113:S.954:), as passed by the Senate, would change the existing provider restrictions currently in statute.  [16] In the House, a hearing held on April 25, 2012, by the House Subcommittee on Rural Development, Research, Biotechnology, and Foreign Agriculture, Committee on Agriculture, debated whether or not the rural broadband loan program should be modified to prohibit loans to projects serving areas with incumbent broadband service providers. [17] [R42524__9___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n### The Universal Service Concept: Background\\\\n Since its creation in 1934 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC, or Commission) has been tasked with \"mak\\\\\\\\[ing\\\\\\\\] available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States ... a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communications service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges. \" [18] This mandate led to the development of what has come to be known as the universal service concept.\\\\n The universal service concept, as originally designed, called for the establishment of policies to ensure that telecommunications services are available to all Americans, including those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, by ensuring that rates remain affordable.  During the 20 \\\\\\\\[th\\\\\\\\] century, government and industry efforts to expand telephone service led to the development of a complex system of cross subsidies to expand the network and address universal service goals.  For example, profits from more densely populated, lower cost urbanized areas helped to subsidize wiring and operation costs for the less populous, higher cost rural areas.\\\\n With the advent of competition and the breakup of the Bell System, the complex system of cross subsidies that evolved to support universal service goals was no longer tenable.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ([P.L. 104-104](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d104:FLD002:@1(104+104)); 47 U.S.C., 1996 act) codified the long-standing commitment by U.S. policymakers to ensure universal service in the provision of telecommunications services (§254), and the FCC established a universal service fund (USF or Fund) to meet the objectives and principles contained in the act.  The 1996 act enumerated specific universal service principles including that \"access to advanced telecommunications and information services should be provided to all regions of the Nation\" (§254 \\\\\\\\[b\\\\\\\\] \\\\\\\\[2\\\\\\\\]) and \"consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas\" (§254 \\\\\\\\[b\\\\\\\\] \\\\\\\\[3\\\\\\\\]).  The concept of universal service was also expanded to include, among other principles, that elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, libraries, and rural health care providers have access to telecommunications services for specific purposes at discounted rates (§254\\\\\\\\[b\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\[6\\\\\\\\] and 254\\\\\\\\[h\\\\\\\\]).\\\\n One of the major policy debates surrounding universal service in the last decade was whether access to advanced telecommunications services (i.e., broadband) should be incorporated into universal service objectives.  With the growing importance and acceptance of broadband and Internet access, gaps in access to such services, particularly in rural areas, generated concern.  A growing number of policymakers felt that the USF should play a role in helping to alleviate this availability gap. They pointed to the provisions, cited above, contained in the Universal Service section of the 1996 act to support their position.  However, with the exception of funding for schools and libraries and rural health care providers, the USF was not designed to directly support broadband.\\\\n Provisions contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) called for the FCC to develop, and submit to Congress, a national broadband plan (NBP) to ensure that every American has \"access to broadband capability. \" [19] This plan, *Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan*, submitted to Congress on March 16, 2010, called for the USF to play a major role in achieving this goal. [R42524__12___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n## High Cost Program\\\\n High-cost support, provided through the High Cost Program, is an example of provider-targeted support.  Under the High Cost Program, eligible telecommunications carriers, usually those serving rural, insular, and other high-cost areas, are able to obtain funds to help offset the higher-than-average costs of providing telephone service.  This mechanism, which has always been the largest USF program based on disbursements, has been particularly important to rural America, where the lack of subscriber density leads to significantly higher costs.  The goal of the USF Order is to restructure and transition the High Cost Program from one that primarily supports voice communications to one that supports a broadband platform that enables multiple applications, including voice.  Although some carriers that received high-cost funding over the years have used high-cost funds to deploy broadband capable infrastructure, there was no requirement that recipients of high-cost funding provide any households in their service areas with broadband.\\\\n The Order requires that the High Cost Program be phased out and replaced in stages, to directly support high-capacity broadband networks (fixed and mobile) through a newly created Connect America Fund which includes the targeted components Mobility Fund and Remote Areas Fund.  The \"identical support rule\" is phased out.  For the first time universal service support provided to carriers serving high-cost areas (which is defined to include all current high-cost support mechanisms as well as the Connect America Fund) is subject to a budget; the budget is frozen at 2011 levels at \\\\\\\\$4.5 billion (plus administrative costs) per year for the next six years (2012-2017), subject to FCC review. [23] [R42524__14___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n### Connect America Fund\\\\n The Order created the Connect America Fund to support the provision of affordable voice and broadband services, both fixed and mobile, of at least 4 Mbps actual download speed and 1 Mbps actual upload speed.  The CAF will eventually replace all the existing support mechanisms in the High Cost Program for eligible carriers.  The path to this transition differs depending on whether a provider is a price cap carrier (i.e., a company whose interstate rates are subject to the price cap form of regulation) or a rate-of-return carrier (a company whose interstate rates are subject to rate-of-return regulation). [24]\\\\n *Price Cap Carriers*.  Price cap incumbent local exchange carriers, [25] which tend to be the large and mid-sized carriers, will transition to the CAF in two phases.  Under Phase I, which commenced on January 1, 2012, legacy high-cost funding is frozen at December 31, 2011, levels (estimated at no more than \\\\\\\\$ 1.8 billion annually) for price cap carriers and is required to be used to achieve universal availability of both voice and broadband.  Frozen high-cost support will equal the amount of support each carrier received in 2011 in a given study area (i.e., the defined geographic service area of an incumbent local exchange carrier\\\\\"s telephone operations).  An additional \\\\\\\\$300 million in \"incremental support\" to stimulate broadband deployment in unserved areas is also established.  This Phase I incremental support is available to those price-cap carriers that choose to deploy fixed broadband to areas not currently served, or targeted to be served, by a fixed broadband provider within their service territory. Access to Phase I incremental support is dependent on meeting specific criteria and build-out requirements, and is offered to jump-start the deployment of broadband to unserved areas within price-cap carrier service areas.  Any price-cap carrier electing to receive Phase I incremental support will receive \\\\\\\\$775 in incremental support for each unserved location it provides broadband with actual speeds of at least 4 Mbps actual download speed and 1 Mbps of actual upload speed. [26] Once the funds are accepted, carriers must meet deployment schedules to no fewer than two-thirds of the required locations within two years and complete all deployments within three years.  Of the \\\\\\\\$300 million made available for Phase I incremental support, only \\\\\\\\$115 million was taken with \\\\\\\\$185 million remaining unclaimed.  [27] A second round of Phase I support will be offered in 2013. [28] The FCC, in May 2013, released a Report and Order detailing the rules for the second round of Phase I incremental support.  [29] Provisions call for a disbursement of \\\\\\\\$485 million (\\\\\\\\$300 million plus the unclaimed \\\\\\\\$185 million from the previous round of incremental support) and expands eligibility to cover areas that are underserved as well as unserved.  [30] Support for unserved areas remains at \\\\\\\\$775 per location and support for underserved areas is set at \\\\\\\\$550 per location.  The FCC anticipates that this will be the last \"incremental support\" round before the transition to Phase II Price Cap annual support and any unused funds will be given to the Phase II Fund.\\\\n Under CAF Phase II Price Cap annual funds (estimated at no more than \\\\\\\\$1.8 billion annually) will be distributed through an FCC-developed cost model and through competitive bidding (e.g., reverse auctions) [31] for a period ending year-end 2017. CAF support will be available only in areas where a federal subsidy is needed to ensure the build-out and continued operation of broadband networks.  By the end of the third year, carriers that accept support must offer broadband speeds of at least 4 Mbps download speed and 1Mbps of upload speed.  In addition, usage capacity must be reasonably comparable to urban residential terrestrial fixed broadband to at least 85% of their high-cost locations and to all supported locations by the end of the fifth year (2017).  The incumbent carrier is given the right of first refusal, until the end-of- 2017, to receive the model-derived support, after which a shift to competitive bidding will be implemented. If an incumbent carrier declines Phase II funding the FCC will implement a competitive bidding process.  CAF Phase II price cap is not expected to be implemented until sometime in 2014.\\\\n *Rate-of-Return Carriers*.  Rate-of-return carriers, [32] which tend to be smaller carriers that solely provide service in rural areas, will continue to receive support, with some modifications, from current support mechanisms pending full transition to the CAF (through 2017).  During this transition, rate-of-return carriers\\\\\" legacy high-cost support is frozen at December 31, 2011, levels (estimated at no more than \\\\\\\\$2 billion annually).  Unlike in the case of price-cap carriers, no additional \"incremental support\" is provided specifically targeted for broadband deployment in unserved areas.  Modifications are made to the operations of the High Cost Program, as they impact rate-of-return carriers, during this transition period to improve \"the efficiency and effectiveness\" of USF support.  [33] For example, the Order phases out support over three years in study areas that overlap completely with an unsubsidized fixed, terrestrial broadband/voice competitor, and gradually phases down over three years (commencing July 1, 2012) per-line support to a cap of \\\\\\\\$250/per month (\\\\\\\\$3,000 annually).\\\\n Rate-of-return carriers that continue to receive legacy support or begin accepting CAF support are given more flexibility than price-cap carriers when deploying broadband.  Rate-of-return carriers are required to offer actual broadband service of at least 4 Mbps download speed and 1 Mbps of upload speed, with usage capacity reasonably comparable to urban residential terrestrial fixed broadband, **but only upon their customers\\\\\"** **reasonable request and within a reasonable amount of time**.  Furthermore, rate-of-return carriers are not, at this time, subject to specific build-out requirements or increased speed requirements and will not necessarily be required to build out and serve the most expensive locations within their service territories.  Many of the details and mechanics of how the transition of rate-of-return carriers from legacy high-cost support to the CAF have yet to be determined.  These details will be announced pending the completion of an extensive Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued as part of the USF Order.  [34] [R42524__15___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n### Mobility Fund\\\\n The CAF Mobility Fund (MF) is a new fund created within the Connect America Fund to provide targeted funding to wireless providers, to support the deployment of 4G (fourth generation) wireless networks. Recipients of funds will be subject to public interest obligations. Phase I provides \\\\\\\\$300 million in one-time support to provide wireless broadband in unserved areas (excluding areas already targeted for support) and was awarded through a reverse auction.  The auction (auction 901), which was held on September 27, 2012, resulted in awards to 33 bidders with new deployment in 31 states and one territory covering 83,000 road miles.  [35] Winners will be required to deploy 4G service within three years, or 3G service within two years and make their networks available to others for roaming.  The FCC is currently in the process of authorizing winning applications.  A separate and complementary one-time Tribal Mobility Fund Phase I was also established to award up to \\\\\\\\$50 million in additional funds to Tribal Lands.  The Tribal Mobility Fund Phase I auction (number 902) is anticipated to be held in October 2013 and will be used to support deployment of mobile voice and broadband to tribal areas lacking 3G or better service.\\\\n Phase II of the Mobility Fund will provide up to \\\\\\\\$500 million per year in ongoing support to expand and sustain mobile voice and broadband services in areas where service would not be available absent federal support.  Funding of \\\\\\\\$100 million per year, within the \\\\\\\\$500 million budget, will be set aside for ongoing support for Tribal Lands.  The FCC sought further comment on specifics relating to the implementation of the Phase II of the Mobility Fund with comment and reply comment dates now closed.  It is anticipated that the auction will be held in the third quarter of 2013 with support to commence in 2014. [R42524__16___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n## Low Income Program\\\\n In the mid-1980s, FCC universal service policies were expanded to target low-income subscribers.  Two income-based programs, Lifeline and Link Up, were established to assist economically needy individuals.  The Link Up program, established in 1987, assists eligible low-income subscribers to pay the costs associated with the initiation of telephone service, and the Lifeline program, established in 1984, assists eligible low-income subscribers to pay the recurring monthly service charges incurred by telephone subscribers.  [38] Discounts are eligible for one connection, either wired or wireless, per household.  The expansion of the USF to directly target low-income individuals is of particular significance to those in rural areas. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the nonmetro poverty rate was 17.0 % in 2011 and has remained consistently higher than the metro poverty rate over time. [39]\\\\n An FCC-conducted broadband consumer survey found that 36% of non-adopters of broadband cited a financial reason as the main reason they do not have broadband service at home. [40] To address this barrier, the FCC adopted an order [41] on January 31, 2012, to modify the goals and operations of the Low Income Program.  The Link Up program is eliminated on non-Tribal Lands, but the role of the Lifeline Program is expanded to increase broadband adoption levels for low-income households; a \\\\\\\\$9.25 flat per-line monthly reimbursement rate is established on an interim basis; [42] and safeguards to combat waste, fraud, and abuse are also established. [43] Actions pertinent to broadband include those which modernize the Lifeline Program as a vehicle to ensure the availability of broadband for all low-income Americans.  This is to be achieved by allowing Lifeline support for bundled service plans that combine voice and broadband and establishing a Broadband Adoption Pilot Program to explore how to best use the Lifeline Program to increase broadband adoption among Lifeline eligible subscribers. [44] In a December 19, 2012, decision the FCC selected 14 projects to participate in the Lifeline pilot program.  The projects cover rural, suburban, and urban areas in 21 states and Puerto Rico.  The FCC authorized approximately \\\\\\\\$13.8 million in funding, which comes from savings resulting from Low Income Program reforms.  The Pilot Program will run for 18 months, beginning on February 1, 2013.  [45] [R42524__20___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n## Rural Health Care Program\\\\n Section 254(h) of the 1996 act requires that public and non-profit rural health care providers have access to telecommunications services necessary for the provision of health care services at rates comparable to those paid for similar services in urban areas.  Subsection 254(h)(1) further specifies that \"to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable,\" health care providers should have access to advanced telecommunications and information services.  The FCC established the Rural Health Care Division (RHCD) within the USAC to administer the universal support program to comply with these provisions.\\\\n Under FCC-established rules only public or non-profit health care providers are eligible to receive funding.  Eligible health care providers, with the exception of those requesting only access to the Internet, must also be located in a rural area. [49] Like the Schools and Libraries program, this support program went into effect on January 1, 1998, and a funding ceiling, or cap, was established, in this case at \\\\\\\\$400 million annually.  The primary use of the funding is to provide reduced rates for telecommunications and information services (e.g., transmission of data, images, or interactive video) necessary for the provision of health care to either qualified individual health care providers or consortia. Health care providers can use funding to save on service they already have, to upgrade current services, or to install new services.  Equipment charges are not eligible for support.  The telecommunications program was established in 1997 to ensure that rural health care providers pay no more than their urban counterparts for their telecommunications needs when providing health care services.  The Internet access program, which was established in 2003, provides a 50% discount on the cost of monthly Internet access in states that are entirely rural [50] and a 25% discount for all other rural health care providers.  Only the monthly charge for access is eligible for support.  These two programs are collectively known as the \"Primary Program.\" [51]\\\\n The FCC, in 2007, established a \"Rural Health Care Pilot Program\" to help public and non-profit health care providers build state- and region-wide broadband networks dedicated to the provision of health care services.  The Pilot Program funds up to 85% of the eligible costs of broadband infrastructure deployment of telehealth networks that connect rural and urban health care providers within a state or region.  The Pilot is closed to new projects and participants will transition to the newly created Healthcare Connect Fund.\\\\n The Healthcare Connect Fund, which was created by the FCC in a December 12, 2012, order, was established to expand access to broadband, particularly in rural areas, for eligible public or not-for-profit health care providers.  [52] The Healthcare Connect Fund, will absorb the Internet Access Program (which is currently part of the Primary Program), and replace the Rural Health Care Pilot Program with a permanent program.  The Healthcare Connect Fund will encourage consortia between smaller rural health care providers and urban medical centers, but consortia must remain majority rural.  The Fund will provide a 65% discount on broadband services, equipment, and connections with health care providers required to contribute the balance (35%).  Upfront payments for the Healthcare Connect Fund is \\\\\\\\$150 million annually.  It is anticipated that the FCC will begin accepting applications in late summer 2013.\\\\n The FCC also established, as part of the Healthcare Connect Fund, a Skilled Nursing Facilities Pilot Program to assess how to support broadband connections for skilled nursing facilities.  The pilot, which is scheduled for a 2014 implementation, will give preference to facilities in rural areas and will receive funding of up to \\\\\\\\$50 million total over a three-year period.  [53] [R42524__22___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n## How Is Success Defined?\\\\n The commitment made under USF reform to ensure universal availability of advanced broadband, at rates that are reasonably comparable in all regions of the nation, is a major undertaking.  How policy makers determine if that goal has been successfully met, however, will depend, to a large part, on how success is defined.  Most consider the universal service mandate to provide voice service to have been met, but the United States has never reached a 100% penetration rate.  According to the FCC, as of July 2011 (the most recent published data available), the telephone subscribership penetration rate in the United States was 95.6%, and rates vary based on characteristics such as location, age, and income.  For example, penetration rates among states ranged from a low of 91.4% to a high of 98.5%; households headed by a person under 25 years of age had a penetration rate of 93.8% compared with at least 95.9% for those headed by a person over 55; penetration rates for households in income categories below \\\\\\\\$20,000 were at, or below, 94.7%, while the rate in households in income categories over \\\\\\\\$75,000 was at least 98.9%.  [54] When it comes to broadband deployment, is anything under 100% an acceptable goal and, if so, what would the appropriate rate be?\\\\n Even if at some point in time broadband is made available in all areas of the country, the question of access versus adoption needs to be considered.  According to the FCC\"s NBP, broadband is available in 95% of the nation but adoption rates are about 65%.  This significant gap is explained by three factors: cost, digital literacy barriers, and a perceived lack of relevance.  [55] The USF Order has attempted to address this issue through reforms including those to the Low Income Program, but the details of how this will be addressed are yet to be fully resolved.\\\\n Additional issues that policymakers may wish to monitor include those related to performance metrics such as speed, capacity, and latency. Although the USF Order provides requirements for such metrics, these needs will continue to evolve.  Just as voice access standards evolved from, for example, party line to single line service, society\"s expectations with regard to broadband will also evolve.  Policymakers will face the task of assessing what the standard for access will be in terms of performance metrics.  What may be considered an acceptable level of service today may be considered inadequate for future needs. [R42524__24___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n## Rural-Rural Divide\\\\n Rural America is subject to a \"rural-rural divide\" when it comes to the presence of broadband infrastructure.  Some parts of rural America have sophisticated high-level broadband access while other parts have little to no broadband access.  Disparity in access to broadband among rural areas is known as the \"rural-rural divide.\"  Price-cap companies, which are largely classified as non-rural carriers, serve both urban and rural areas and in their rural service areas face issues, such as remoteness and lack of density resulting in high costs, more commonly associated with rural carriers.  According to the FCC, more than 83% of the approximately 18 million Americans that lack access to residential fixed broadband at or above the FCC\\\\\"s broadband speed benchmark live in areas served by price-cap carriers.  [60] In other rural areas, often served by rate-of-return carriers, broadband is being deployed, often with the support of a combination of RUS loans and USF support.  To address this disparity the FCC, in its USF Order, established a \\\\\\\\$300 million incremental support component in the Phase I CAF Fund for areas lacking broadband infrastructure, solely for the use of price-cap carriers.\\\\n Concern has been expressed that providing for a CAF Phase I Fund for broadband deployment, solely for the use of price-cap carriers, disadvantages rural areas lacking broadband infrastructure that are served by the smaller, rural rate-of-return carriers.  Some question why access to such funding should be limited to price-cap carriers when other areas of the nation are facing the same, or even more challenging, conditions to bring broadband to areas lacking access.  If the ultimate goal is to bring broadband to all unserved areas, they ask, why should this funding be based on carrier classification rather than need?  They also point to the fact that \\\\\\\\$185 million of the \\\\\\\\$300 million total for 2012 went unclaimed to further support their position that this support should be opened to all providers. [R42524__26___1]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n## Role of Congress\\\\n Congress is seeking ways to best leverage federal programs to ensure that the goals of the National Broadband Plan—including universal broadband service by 2020—are met to the greatest extent possible.  With the September 30, 2010, conclusion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ([P.L. 111-5](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d111:FLD002:@1(111+5))) broadband grant and loan awards, the RUS broadband programs and the USF programs remain the only ongoing federal vehicles to provide financial assistance for rural broadband deployment.\\\\n With both programs currently at a pivotal point, an issue for the 113 \\\\\\\\[th\\\\\\\\] Congress is how best to shape those programs as they go forward. The statute authorizing the Rural Broadband Loan and Loan Guarantee—Section 601 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936—was significantly modified in the 2008 farm bill, and is being addressed once more in the 2013 farm bill.  [64] Typically a new farm bill is developed every five years, principally by the House Committee on Agriculture and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.  The Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate both have a major role to play as well, as each considers annual appropriations for the RUS broadband programs through the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.\\\\n Meanwhile, the USF is undergoing a major and unprecedented transition through a series of reforms being implemented by the FCC.  Congress has largely adopted an oversight role and a \"wait and see\" posture with respect to the FCC\\\\\"s USF reforms.  [65] While numerous Members have written letters to the FCC urging various modifications in the reform package, there was no comprehensive legislation introduced into the 112 \\\\\\\\[th\\\\\\\\] Congress that addressed the FCC\\\\\"s USF reforms.  The House Energy and Commerce Committee, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the House Committee on Natural Resources continue to assess the impact of the reforms, and the FCC\\\\\"s progress in their implementation.  To the extent that various constituencies and interest groups (whether it be small rate-of-return carriers, large price-cap carriers, competitive providers, state utility regulators, or broadband providers and consumers) feel they are disadvantaged by the reforms, and to the extent that programmatic inefficiencies or waste, fraud, and abuse come to light (as they have in the past through GAO reports, for example), Congress always has the prerogative in the future of formulating and considering legislation that could modify those reforms by amending the 1934 Communications Act. [66]\\\\n Given that the RUS and USF broadband programs share the goal of deploying broadband to rural America, Congress may also wish to assess how these two programs can best fit together.  Are they effectively targeted towards providing broadband to the most unserved areas of the nation, while at the same time minimizing adverse impacts on private incumbent providers?  Are they the most cost-effective way for Congress to fund rural broadband development?  To what extent are the two programs complementary and to what extent do the two programs overlap?  And finally, how will changes made to the USF program affect the viability of broadband loans made under the RUS programs? [R42524__29___1]'"
