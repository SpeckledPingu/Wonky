       "   'query': 'Income inequality in South Africa is profoundly shaped by historical and ongoing economic factors stemming from the legacy of apartheid. The most significant driver remains the persistent racial wealth gap, with Black South Africans disproportionately lacking access to land ownership, quality education, and stable employment – a direct consequence of discriminatory policies that systematically denied opportunities. Furthermore, structural unemployment, particularly among youth, contributes significantly; many jobs available are low-paying and offer limited prospects for advancement, perpetuating cycles of poverty. Key indicators like the Gini coefficient consistently demonstrate high levels of inequality, reflecting this disparity.\\n\\nBeyond historical factors, contemporary economic forces play a crucial role. Globalization and neoliberal policies have led to increased competition in certain sectors, often benefiting skilled workers while displacing low-skilled labor. The informal sector remains large, offering precarious employment with limited social protection and earnings potential.  Additionally, the concentration of wealth among a relatively small segment of the population – often referred to as “kronas” – exacerbates inequality through capital accumulation and investment decisions, further limiting economic mobility for many South Africans.',\n",

       "  {'question': 'How have post-apartheid economic policies contributed to unemployment rates in South Africa?',\n",
       "   'query': 'Post-apartheid economic policies in South Africa, while aiming for redress and equitable distribution of wealth following decades of systematic racial segregation, have arguably contributed to persistently high unemployment rates. The implementation of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies, intended to uplift previously disadvantaged communities through ownership and control within the economy, faced challenges including a lack of skills development and insufficient support structures. Simultaneously, macroeconomic policies focused on fiscal consolidation and attracting foreign investment, often prioritized short-term growth over job creation, particularly in sectors benefiting primarily skilled labor. This resulted in a ‘skills mismatch’ – a significant gap between available jobs and the qualifications of the unemployed workforce – exacerbated by limited investment in vocational training and tertiary education aligned with market demands.\\n\\nFurthermore, structural adjustment programs imposed by international financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF during this period emphasized privatization and deregulation, leading to job losses in state-owned enterprises and reduced labor protections. The transition also saw a decline in manufacturing employment due to increased global competition and shifting production patterns. Key indicators such as the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP), designed to create temporary jobs, have demonstrated limited long-term impact on reducing structural unemployment, highlighting the need for more targeted and sustained interventions focused on skills development, inclusive growth strategies, and addressing inequality – core components of broader economic factors impacting South Africa.',\n",

       "  {'question': 'What is the impact of foreign investment on South Africa’s GDP and economic stability?',\n",
       "   'query': \"Foreign investment plays a complex and often debated role in South Africa’s GDP and economic stability. Historically, increased foreign direct investment (FDI) – encompassing investments made by companies based outside of South Africa – has been linked to GDP growth through capital inflows, technology transfer, job creation, and expansion of productive capacity. These investments contribute directly to the production of goods and services, boosting overall output measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, the impact isn't uniformly positive; volatile investment flows, particularly speculative capital, can exacerbate economic instability, leading to currency fluctuations and potentially triggering financial crises, as seen during periods of heightened risk aversion.\\n\\nFurthermore, South Africa’s economic stability is significantly influenced by the *nature* of foreign investment – not just the volume. Investments in sectors like mining (often attracting FDI) have historically been linked to commodity price volatility and resource dependence. Simultaneously, domestic investment, driven by local savings and government spending, remains crucial for long-term sustainable growth.  Indicators such as the Foreign Portfolio Equity Index (FPEI) and the current account balance are closely monitored to assess the overall health of the economy in relation to foreign capital inflows and outflows, highlighting the delicate balance between attracting FDI and maintaining macroeconomic stability – a key consideration within broader economic factors impacting South Africa.\",\n",

These patterns varied by sex, race, and ethnicity.  Most of the increase in wage inequality at the bottom of the distribution occurred by 1990 and leveled off by 2000, whereas inequality continued to grow at the top of the distribution after 2000.  Lower wages are associated with less education, and the college wage premium (the ratio of earnings of those with a college degree over those with a high school degree) grew steeply until 2000.  The labor income share of compensation has declined beginning around 2000.  Both the growth in hourly wage inequality and the decline in the labor share of compensation contributed to greater inequality of before-tax income.  From 1979 to 2017, the income share of the bottom quintile fell from 5.3% to 3.5%, whereas the share of the top quintile rose from 41.9% to 50.1%.\\n Several factors potentially contributed to this change in wage inequality: technological advancement, globalization, wage-setting institutional changes (i.e., the minimum wage, presence of labor unions, and decline in the large firm wage premium), immigration, and declines in job mobility, across jobs in general and geographically.\\n A review of the economic research suggests that a major force in causing this growing wage inequality and lower wage growth was skill-based technological change (change increasing the demand for skilled over unskilled workers).  Although there is mixed evidence, most studies find a smaller, modest effect of globalization (although trade affects locations and sectors differently).  The minimum wage appeared to play a relatively small role.  The decline in wages has coincided with the decline in unions, but to some extent, the decline in unions was a consequence of the decline in jobs in heavily unionized sectors due to technological advancement.  Given the size of the decline and the union wage premium, as well as tracing some of the decline to technology, unionization appears to be of limited importance.  The decline in the wage premium for large firms may also be traced to increased competition from technological advancement and globalization.  Evidence also indicates that immigration had little effect on the distribution of wages, but resulted in a slight increase in inequality because immigrants are concentrated at the upper and lower ends of the income distribution.  A decline in labor force mobility has occurred in recent years and could have contributed in some way to inequality.\\n Because the causes of the wage stagnation and growth inequality appear to be traceable largely to technological change, which is otherwise valued, other policies might be considered to increase the well-being of workers whose wages have stagnated.  One policy option is to either increase transfers, including those provided through the tax structure, such as the earned income tax credit.  Childless workers, in particular, have small earned income credits.  Another option is to increase the federal minimum wage, although states are gradually undertaking these increases.  A more far-reaching policy option is a federally guaranteed job.  Proposals have also been made to expand wage insurance, which currently is available to only a narrow group of trade-affected workers. Policies to increase skill acquisition, including a greatly expanded apprenticeship program, could be considered, although they would have delayed effects on inequality.  A variety of policies have been advanced to strengthen unions.  In addition, a number of policies might be considered to increase labor mobility.  Finally, a variety of geographically targeted provisions aimed particularly at increasing employment in chronically high unemployment areas could be considered. Transfers, including the earned income credit, have improved the distribution of after-tax income, but some other policies have a less successful track record, and some (such as a guaranteed job) are untried.\\n \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n \\n\\n The stagnation of real hourly wages at the lower end of the income distribution, where workers tend to be less educated, has entered into the policy debate over many issues, including trade, immigration, and institutional factors such as the minimum wage.  This lack of wage growth has also contributed to an increase in overall income inequality.  The first section reviews changes in the distribution of hourly wages (as well as considering the effects of fringe benefits) and overall income. Following that review, the report reviews the evidence on the main factors that might have contributed to this lack of wage growth, including technological advancement, trade, the minimum wage, unions, the large firm wage premium, immigration, and reduced labor mobility. The final section of the report explores policy options that might be considered by Congress. (R46212(4))',\n",

       "    'text': '## Background\\n The people of South Africa are highly diverse.  Black Africans make up more than three-quarters of the population, but come from several different ethnic backgrounds.  Most whites are Afrikaans speakers of Dutch, German, and French Huguenot ancestry, but there is a substantial English-speaking white minority.  The remainder of the population are Asian, largely of Indian descent, and people of mixed race.\\n\\n\\n South Africa\\'s economy, the largest on the continent, is diverse as well.  South Africa produces wine, wool, maize and other agricultural products for export, although only about 12% of the country\\'s land is suitable for agriculture.  Moreover, South Africa is the world\\'s leading producer of gold, platinum, and chromium.  Major industrial sectors include automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, foodstuffs, and iron and steel production.  South African cell phone companies and other firms are active throughout Africa, and SABMiller, formerly South African Breweries, operates on a global scale.  The country\\'s stock exchange is among the 20 largest in the world, and South Africa is one of the few countries on the continent to rank as an upper middle income country. Despite its many economic strengths, however, the country ranks as one of the most unequal societies in the world in terms of income distribution.  The majority of black South Africans live in poverty, and South Africa\\'s cities are surrounded by vast informal housing settlements known as \"townships.\"  Shortages of water, electricity, and other social services in the townships have contributed to growing tensions, as evidenced by a rise in township protests in recent years.\\n South Africa is an influential actor in the international relations of Africa.  South Africa served from 2007 through 2008 as one of the 10 non-permanent members of the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council; it has been elected to serve another two-year term beginning in January 2011.  The country remains a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.  Its voting record on both bodies has been considered by some to be controversial.  South Africa was a founding member of the African Union (AU), successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and then-President Thabo Mbeki served as the AU\\'s first chairperson. President Mbeki also took a lead role in the creation of the New Partnership for Africa\\'s Development (NEPAD), an African-designed plan for improved governance within Africa and increased western aid, trade, and investment that was adopted by the AU as a blueprint for the continent\\'s economic development.  South Africa has repeatedly put itself forward as a venue for major international conferences, such as the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, the 2001 World Conference on Racism.  In 2010, South Africa was the first African nation to host the soccer World Cup, and in December 2011, the country will host the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.  South Africa is the only African member of the G20, the premier forum for international economic cooperation.\\n Weak regimes and instability elsewhere in the region have historically had a negative impact on South Africa, and the country continues to face a large influx of illegal immigrants.  By some estimates, more than three million Zimbabweans currently reside illegally in South Africa.  Some South Africans blame these immigrants for the country\\'s high crime and unemployment rates, and in May 2008 tensions erupted in the townships, sparking a wave of xenophobic attacks that displaced over 25,000 and left over 60 dead.  Isolated attacks have occurred since then, and the potential for further violence cannot be ruled out.\\n In order to promote greater stability, South African officials have played prominent mediator roles in African conflicts, and South African troops actively support peacekeeping missions throughout the continent. In 2002, they helped to persuade the parties to the prolonged conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to sign a peace agreement following negotiations in South Africa.  President Thabo Mbeki was less successful in mediating the conflict in Cote d\\'Ivoire, a country which continues to face political turmoil.  Former President Nelson Mandela played a leading role in brokering a peace agreement in Burundi, and South Africa contributed hundreds of troops to the peacekeeping mission there.  Over 1,200 South African troops are currently participating as peacekeepers in the U.N. Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO), and over 900 South African soldiers and police serve under the U.N.-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID).  In a move believed by many to protest the Sudanese government\\'s policies in Darfur, the Mbeki government was instrumental in preventing Sudan from attaining the chairmanship of the African Union in 2006.  It has, however, protested the imposition of tougher U.N. sanctions against Sudan and an International Criminal Court (ICC) indictment of Sudanese President Omar al Bashir as counterproductive.  [1] Former President Mbeki continues to play an active mediation role in Sudan.  The country has supported democratic advances on the continent, providing millions of ballots in 2006 for elections in the DRC.  In 2007, the heads of state of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) nominated then-President Mbeki as mediator between the Zimbabwean government and the opposition in an effort to resolve its political and economic crises.  Mbeki\\'s role was controversial.  President Jacob Zuma and a team of his own mediators took over in late 2009. (RL31697(5))',\n",
       "    'summary': 'Over fifteen years after the South African majority gained its independence from white minority rule under apartheid, a system of racial segregation, the Republic of South Africa is firmly established as a regional power. With Africa’s largest Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a diverse economy, and a government that has played an active role in promoting regional peace and stability, South Africa is poised to have a substantial impact on the economic and political future of Africa. The country is also playing an increasingly prominent role in the G20 and other international fora. South Africa is twice the size of Texas and has a population of almost 50 million. Its political system is regarded as stable, but South Africa faces serious long-term challenges arising from poverty, unemployment, and AIDS. \\nThe United States government considers South Africa to be one of its strategic partners on the continent, and the two countries commenced a new Strategic Dialogue in 2010, with the encouragement of the U.S. Congress. Bilateral relations are cordial; however, the U.S. and South African administrations have expressed differences with respect to the situations in Zimbabwe and Iran, among other foreign policy issues. South Africa begins a two-year term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in 2011; U.S. officials articulated frustration with the South African government on positions it took during its last term on the Council in 2007-2008. \\nThe African National Congress (ANC), which led the struggle against apartheid, has dominated the political scene since the end of apartheid and continues to enjoy widespread support among the population. The party has suffered internal divisions, though, some of which contributed to the resignation of President Thabo Mbeki in 2008 and the formation of a breakaway party, the Congress of the People (COPE). The ANC fell short of retaining its two-thirds majority in the parliament during the most recent elections, held in April 2009. Jacob Zuma, elected as head of the ANC in late 2007, weathered a series of corruption charges and was chosen by the ANC-dominated parliament after the 2009 elections to serve as the country’s newest President.\\nSouth Africa has the largest HIV/AIDS population in the world, with almost 6 million people reportedly HIV positive. The Mbeki Administration’s policy on HIV/AIDS was controversial, but the Zuma Administration has made significant commitments to addressing the disease. The country has weathered a series of corruption scandals, and continues to struggle with high crime and unemployment rates. Mounting social tensions related to the competition for jobs, resources, and social services led to an eruption of xenophobic violence against immigrants in 2008; some resentment against foreign workers in the country lingers. South Africa, with its wealth of mineral resources and diverse manufacturing sector, has benefitted from steady economic growth in recent years, but the country weathered a recession in 2009 and economists predict weaker growth prospects for the near future. Job creation remains a major challenge for the government.\\nIn 2010, South Africa successfully hosted the largest event ever held on the African continent, the FIFA World Cup, an international football (soccer) competition. The government and the private sector undertook a wide variety of construction and infrastructure projects in preparation for the event, which was attended by over three million people and drew over 300,000 tourists. South Africa defied many expectations during the event—six new stadiums were finished on time, crime was low, and South Africans introduced the world to a long (and loud) plastic horn known as the vuvuzela. Americans bought more tickets to the event than any other nationality. The games were a point of pride, not only to South Africans, but to many across Africa.',\n",

       "    'text': '## The Economy\\n South Africa\\'s economy is diverse and, until Nigeria revalued its gross domestic product (GDP) measurement methodology in April 2014, was the largest in Africa.  [56] The country is a famed wine producer and exports a range of agricultural products, such as wool, maize, sugar, and fruit and juice, although only about 10% of its land is arable and agriculture contributes less than 3% of the GDP. Industrial contributions to GDP, at 28.4% in 2012, are far more significant.  South Africa is the world\\'s leading producer of platinum and chromium and a major gold, diamond, and coal producer.  Other key industrial sectors include automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, foodstuffs, and iron and steel production.  Services contribute the largest share of GDP, 69%.  [57] South Africa has large and well-developed tourism, banking, energy, legal, communications, and transport sectors.  South African cell phone companies and other firms are active throughout Africa, and SABMiller, formerly South African Breweries, operates globally.  The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is among the 20 largest exchanges globally, and South Africa is one of the few African upper middle income countries (defined by the World Bank as those with a per capita gross national income of \\\\$4,086-\\\\$12,615 in 2012).\\n Domestically, South Africa faces a number of economic challenges.  Low local savings rates mean that South African firms seeking credit must often turn to foreign sources of finance.  Government deficits have increased in recent years, from an average of 0.5% of GDP from 2005 to 2008 to an average of nearly 5% of GDP from 2009 to 2012, and government net debt as a percent of GDP has grown from a low of about 23% in 2008 to over 34% in 2012.  Total external debt stocks have risen steadily, from \\\\$68 billion in 2008 to nearly \\\\$114 billion in 2011. [58] Due to population increases, real per capita GDP growth has also lagged behind national GDP growth rates.\\n An inadequately educated workforce is widely seen as a key hindrance to growth.  Education quality in South Africa ranks poorly in international comparisons, despite large investments in the sector. [59] High unemployment, limited access to social services, and diverse public infrastructure investment needs are also viewed as key barriers to economic growth.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), distortions of demand, supply, and pricing in the labor market, together with other market imbalances, have undermined South Africa\\'s economic production potential and helped \"to preserv\\\\[e\\\\] inequality and high unemployment. \" [60] Despite efforts to increase electricity generation capacity, lack of power is another serious problem.

       "    'summary': 'South Africa is a multi-racial, majority black southern African country of nearly 52 million. It held its first universal suffrage elections in 1994, after a transition from white minority rule under apartheid, a system of state-enforced racial segregation and socioeconomic discrimination. South Africa entered a period of mourning in late 2013, upon the death of its first post-apartheid president, Nelson Mandela. He is viewed as the founding father of the countrys nonracial democratic system, the 20th anniversary of which was recently celebrated prior to national elections on May 7. South Africa is influential regionally, due to its political, trade, and investment ties across Africa and its active role within the African Union. It is viewed as a U.S. strategic partner in Africa, despite periodic foreign policy differences. In mid-2013, President Obama traveled to South Africa, among other African countries. Key issues addressed in South Africa included bilateral political and trade and investment ties, development cooperation, and shared U.S.-South African aims regarding similar issues across Africa, as well as democracy, youth leadership development, and peace and security.\\nCongress has long been engaged with South Africa, notably during the anti-apartheid struggle, and with regard to post-apartheid socioeconomic development efforts, a key focus of bilateral ties. Since 1992, South Africa has been a leading recipient of U.S. foreign aid, mostly devoted to addressing HIV/AIDS and other health challenges. Aid oversight has drawn the bulk of South Africa-related congressional attention in recent years. U.S. policy makers are also increasingly focused on efforts to strengthen already growing U.S.-South African trade and investment ties. Other key areas of bilateral engagement include security cooperation and an ongoing U.S.-South African Strategic Dialogue. Established in 2010, the Dialogue centers on health, education, food security, law enforcement, trade, investment, and energy, among other issues.\\nSouth Africa has the largest, most diversified, and highly industrialized economy in Africa. It has enjoyed moderate economic growth in most recent years. Average per capita incomes and access to education have grown across racial groups, notably for blacks. Despite post-apartheid national socioeconomic gains, South Africa remains a highly unequal society with respect to wealth and income distribution and access to jobs, social services, utilities, and land. Most blacks are poor, and average black incomes are far smaller than those of the historically privileged white minority. Blacks also suffer very high unemployment rates (36% in 2011), and have far less access to education. Shortages of quality housing, utilities, and social services in townshipsthe vast, high-density housing settlements where many of the poor livespur ongoing social and political tensions. Other key problems include public corruption and widespread violent crime. Vigilante justice and mob violence is not uncommon, and heavy-handed police tactics sometimes result in human rights abuses. South Africa also suffers high rates of HIV/AIDS.\\nIn late 2012, the governing African National Congress (ANC) party, despite some reported internal divisions, reelected as its president Jacob Zuma, ahead of the May 2014 national elections. The parliament elected Zuma to his first term as president of South Africa in 2009. The ANC government faces the substantial challenges noted above, along with others, including labor unrest, rising dissatisfaction within key labor constituencies, and dissatisfaction among youths. Youth populations face particularly high jobless rates and may lack older generations continuing allegiance and gratitude to the ANC for helping to end apartheid. To address these diverse challenges, all of which are electoral issues, the government is investing billions of dollars to upgrade infrastructure and improve public service delivery, but is likely to face continuing challenges in meeting popular expectations.',\n",

       "    'text': '## The Economy\\n In 2009, South Africa weathered its first recession in 17 years.  The rate of growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged 3% per year in the first decade after apartheid and rose to an average of 5% from 2004 to 2007.  The growth rate fell to 3.7% in 2008 and -1.8% in 2009, due in part to the global economic downturn; it rose to an estimated 2.8% in 2010.  The growth rate is expected to rise to 3.7% in 2011. [46] Much higher rates will be needed if South Africa is to substantially increase employment among the black majority and reduce the sharp inequalities in income distribution among the races.  Unemployment estimates range from 25% to 40%, far above the government\\'s target of 15%.  The vast, poverty-stricken townships surrounding South Africa\\'s cities remain a potential source of political instability.  In recent years periodic riots have erupted in several poor municipalities to protest local government corruption and inadequate service delivery.  Although turnout and support for the ANC remained high nationally in the country\\'s last nationwide municipal elections, voters boycotted the polls in a number of townships in which the ANC had formerly enjoyed strong support, and several hundred former ANC supporters stood as independent candidates.  Conditions in the townships have improved marginally with the expanded availability of electricity and the provision of clean water taps.  However, the widening gap between the rich and poor is likely to pose a continuing challenge. (RL31697(18))\\n### Economic Policies Under Thabo Mbeki\\n South Africa won praise from international economists for its reform-oriented macro-economic policy in the late 1990s, which, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, \"demonstrated its commitment to open markets, privatization, and a favorable investment climate, moving away from the former government\\'s strategy of import substitution and industrial development that protected local industries with high tariff barriers. \" [47] The policy, known as the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, delivered mixed results—it engendered macroeconomic stability, fiscal discipline, and trade liberalization.  However, unemployment continued to rise, and income distribution remained highly skewed, largely along racial lines.  Nevertheless, the income of the average black household almost doubled in the first decade after the end of apartheid.  In late 2007, the government announced that the average national income had risen 22% since 1999. [48]\\n In 2005, the government unveiled a new economic plan, the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA).  It was designed to raise the economic growth rate to 4.5% from 2004-2009 and to at least 6% from 2010-1014 through targeted interventions, including public investment in infrastructure, and to cut unemployment rates in half by 2014.  These targets, optimistic prior to the economic downturn, are likely now unattainable in the near term.\\n Some economists attribute South Africa\\'s economic difficulties, in part, to the slow pace of privatization.  Despite its commitment to privatization, the Mbeki government remained heavily involved in transportation, communications, energy production, and the defense sector, and after the 2004 elections expressed a desire to restructure most remaining state-owned enterprises rather than expand privatization. Further privatization delays were due in part to government concerns that privatization would boost unemployment temporarily, fueling criticism from COSATU and the SACP.  According to COSATU and SACP, the job cutbacks that often follow privatization are contributing to the country\\'s unemployment and growing income gap. (RL31697(19))\\n### Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)\\n The government has sought to promote \"black empowerment\" by assuring that a significant portion of the shares in privatized companies would be acquired by black South Africans rather than by wealthy whites or foreign investors.  Its Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) program, initiated in 1994, was designed to address racial inequalities in the business sector.  In 1994, blacks owned less than 5% of the country\\'s private enterprises.  As of 2008, there were over 15 black-owned and 29 black-empowered companies listed on the South African stock exchange. The rise in black ownership has been echoed by a significant increase in the black middle class.  Nevertheless, the lack of skilled labor may be hampering the program, as may complicated or unclear regulations.  In 2007, the government instituted the BEE Codes of Good Practice, which make both listed and unlisted companies subject to empowerment requirements and targets, but offer concessions to small businesses and foreign investors.  [49] A new economic growth strategy introduced by the government in November 2010 (see below) proposes a \"major re-think\" and \"substantial revision\" of the BEE codes to increase jobs, skills development, and investment. (RL31697(20))\\n### Foreign Investment\\n In the first decade of post-apartheid rule, analysts expressed concern over the government\\'s ability to attract foreign investment at the levels needed to spur growth.  Sound macroeconomic policies, including reduced tariffs and export subsidies, the loosening of exchange controls, improved enforcement of intellectual property laws, and legislation designed to improve competition have been cited by observers as responsible for the country\\'s economic growth.  A World Bank study finds that South Africa is one of the top 35 easiest countries in which to do business.  [50] Investors are, however, reportedly worried by labor relations, high crime rates, and corruption.  Transparency International ranks South Africa 54 out of 178 in its 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating that it is perceived as less corrupt than other Sub-Saharan African countries (only four African countries ranked less corrupt than South Africa), but more corrupt than many competitors for investment in other parts of the world.  [51] Its ranking has fallen from 43 in 2007.  Political risks arising from potential instability in Zimbabwe are regarded as another deterrent to investors, and South Africa\\'s own racial, class, and political divisions are seen as sources of concern.  Analysts have also highlighted the country\\'s executive \"brain drain\" as one of the greatest threats to South Africa\\'s economic progress. (RL31697(21))',\n",
       "    'summary': 'Over fifteen years after the South African majority gained its independence from white minority rule under apartheid, a system of racial segregation, the Republic of South Africa is firmly established as a regional power. With Africa’s largest Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a diverse economy, and a government that has played an active role in promoting regional peace and stability, South Africa is poised to have a substantial impact on the economic and political future of Africa. The country is also playing an increasingly prominent role in the G20 and other international fora. South Africa is twice the size of Texas and has a population of almost 50 million. Its political system is regarded as stable, but South Africa faces serious long-term challenges arising from poverty, unemployment, and AIDS. \\nThe United States government considers South Africa to be one of its strategic partners on the continent, and the two countries commenced a new Strategic Dialogue in 2010, with the encouragement of the U.S. Congress. Bilateral relations are cordial; however, the U.S. and South African administrations have expressed differences with respect to the situations in Zimbabwe and Iran, among other foreign policy issues. South Africa begins a two-year term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in 2011; U.S. officials articulated frustration with the South African government on positions it took during its last term on the Council in 2007-2008. \\nThe African National Congress (ANC), which led the struggle against apartheid, has dominated the political scene since the end of apartheid and continues to enjoy widespread support among the population. The party has suffered internal divisions, though, some of which contributed to the resignation of President Thabo Mbeki in 2008 and the formation of a breakaway party, the Congress of the People (COPE). The ANC fell short of retaining its two-thirds majority in the parliament during the most recent elections, held in April 2009. Jacob Zuma, elected as head of the ANC in late 2007, weathered a series of corruption charges and was chosen by the ANC-dominated parliament after the 2009 elections to serve as the country’s newest President.\\nSouth Africa has the largest HIV/AIDS population in the world, with almost 6 million people reportedly HIV positive. The Mbeki Administration’s policy on HIV/AIDS was controversial, but the Zuma Administration has made significant commitments to addressing the disease. The country has weathered a series of corruption scandals, and continues to struggle with high crime and unemployment rates. Mounting social tensions related to the competition for jobs, resources, and social services led to an eruption of xenophobic violence against immigrants in 2008; some resentment against foreign workers in the country lingers. South Africa, with its wealth of mineral resources and diverse manufacturing sector, has benefitted from steady economic growth in recent years, but the country weathered a recession in 2009 and economists predict weaker growth prospects for the near future. Job creation remains a major challenge for the government.\\nIn 2010, South Africa successfully hosted the largest event ever held on the African continent, the FIFA World Cup, an international football (soccer) competition. The government and the private sector undertook a wide variety of construction and infrastructure projects in preparation for the event, which was attended by over three million people and drew over 300,000 tourists. South Africa defied many expectations during the event—six new stadiums were finished on time, crime was low, and South Africans introduced the world to a long (and loud) plastic horn known as the vuvuzela. Americans bought more tickets to the event than any other nationality. The games were a point of pride, not only to South Africans, but to many across Africa.',\n",

       "    'text': '### Economic Policy Under Zuma\\n In general, the Zuma government has pursued a free-market, private sector-driven economic model underpinned by large actual or planned state investments aimed at spurring increased economic growth, productivity, and job creation.  Such investments support infrastructure construction, job skills training, public works and service jobs, and selected private sector projects determined to have the potential to increase employment and enhance economic productivity.  In late 2010, the Zuma Administration launched a medium-term growth strategy, the *New Growth Path*.  Its centerpiece is an industrial policy aimed at expanding economic output, creating 5 million new jobs, and reducing unemployment from 25% to 15% by 2020.  It targets large public infrastructure investments in five key areas: energy, transport, communication, water, and housing.  It also funds investment and human resource development programs aimed at increasing jobs and output in the \"green economy\" (solar, wind, and biofuels industries); agriculture; manufacturing; tourism and other services; and mining.  It calls for the creation of a state mining firm focused on value-added processing and \"enhanced resource exploitation in competition with a strong private mining sector. \" It also calls for state fiscal discipline and emphasizes diverse roles for the private sector.  Some aspects of the new strategy, including proposals to cap wages and bonuses, have met with objections from unions and from business interests, which fear that private sector pay bonus caps may deter FDI.\\n Spending on such infrastructure and capital investment projects, along with institution capacity-building projects, is forecast to total about \\\\$97 billion over the next three years and \\\\$600 billion over the next decade.  Increasing public expenditures are reflected in South Africa\\'s first-ever trillion-plus Rand (about \\\\$150 billion) budget in its 2012/2013 budget year.  The government has also suggested that it may expand the role of state development finance institutions in funding its agenda, although most spending is set to come from state agencies\\' operating capital and 30% from the open market.  This agenda has left private industry unsure of its role in the government\\'s plans and has led business interest groups to call for the creation of infrastructure-focused public-private partnerships.  Critics have also questioned whether state agencies and parastatals (partially or wholly publicly owned commercial entities) are up to the job, in light of factors such as massive state project delays, cost overruns, and failures to expend funding allocated for infrastructure construction. [65] State efforts to access financing to fund public investments could be hindered by labor unrest and corruption.  In late 2012, these factors helped spur country economic risk rating downgrades or warnings (e.g., by Moody\\'s, Standard and Poor\\'s, and Fitch), which may make public investment financing more expensive, and potentially prompt the government to seek funding from international financial institutions or non-Western lenders, such as China.\\n South Africa\\'s public spending is creating significant market opportunities for U.S. business backed by U.S. public export financing assistance, notably the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im).  It financed several large deals in South Africa in 2011 and 2012, including two rail locomotive manufacturing deals involving GE Transportation, a U.S. firm, and South African rails parastatals.  In 2011, Ex-Im approved an \\\\$805.6 million direct loan to help finance a major expansion of a large coal fired power plant run by South Africa\\'s state electricity utility.  In 2012, Ex-Im signed an agreement of intent to provide financing for South African purchases of up to \\\\$2 billion in U.S. technologies, products, and services, most related to clean energy production and South African government infrastructure construction initiatives. [66] (R43130(21))\\n## Key Policies to Increase Economic Equality\\n Since 1994, successive post-apartheid governments have pursued two major efforts to increase racial economic equality.  One, known as Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), seeks to promote the increased participation of blacks throughout the South African economy, a process dubbed \"transformation.\"  The other, land reform (a set of inter-related policies), seeks to increase black land ownership, among other goals. (R43130(22))\\n### Black Economic Empowerment\\n BEE policies primarily seek to increase access to jobs by blacks and certain other marginalized groups in all occupational categories and levels of employment, and to increase rates of ownership and management of firms and other types of productive entities by these groups.  Initial BEE efforts prioritized business ownership transfers to blacks, as well as preferential black access to corporate leadership positions, leading to criticisms that BEE was creating a privileged black class rather than achieving broad black \"economic empowerment.\" [67] To address such criticisms, current BEE policies more heavily emphasize efforts to advance racial employment equity, and to provide job training and other skills development services to blacks and other BEE beneficiaries.\\n Implementation of BEE goals is mandatory for public entities.  The government promotes private sector investment in BEE goals by working with industries to set up sector-specific transformation best practice \"charters\" and \"sector codes,\" but the main tool for fostering attainment of BEE goals is BEE scorecards, which assess a business\\'s attainment of a range of benchmarks.  BEE scorecards are used as eligibility criteria in public procurement, some forms of licensing, participation in public-private partnership deals and transactions (e.g., sales of state-owned assets), tax preferences, public company stock listings, and other matters of economic concern to firms.  Higher scores can be attained if a firm\\'s suppliers meet BEE goals, a measure aimed at using business demand to drive private sector adoption of BEE policies.  There are some exemptions from BEE policies for small firms. For larger and more complex firms, BEE compliance is highly legalistic and is accompanied by paperwork-intensive reporting requirements. [68] In June 2013, the government introduced a BEE amendment bill that would create a range of BEE policy implementation monitoring, oversight, and advocacy measures and mechanisms and introduce new offenses and penalties for scorecard misrepresentation.

Blacks also suffer very high unemployment rates (36% in 2011), and have far less access to education. Shortages of quality housing, utilities, and social services in townshipsthe vast, high-density housing settlements where many of the poor livespur ongoing social and political tensions. Other key problems include public corruption and widespread violent crime. Vigilante justice and mob violence is not uncommon, and heavy-handed police tactics sometimes result in human rights abuses. South Africa also suffers high rates of HIV/AIDS.\\nIn late 2012, the governing African National Congress (ANC) party, despite some reported internal divisions, reelected as its president Jacob Zuma, ahead of the May 2014 national elections. The parliament elected Zuma to his first term as president of South Africa in 2009. The ANC government faces the substantial challenges noted above, along with others, including labor unrest, rising dissatisfaction within key labor constituencies, and dissatisfaction among youths. Youth populations face particularly high jobless rates and may lack older generations continuing allegiance and gratitude to the ANC for helping to end apartheid. To address these diverse challenges, all of which are electoral issues, the government is investing billions of dollars to upgrade infrastructure and improve public service delivery, but is likely to face continuing challenges in meeting popular expectations.',\n",

       "    'text': \"### Summary\\n This report provides an overview of global Foreign Direct Investment in the People's Republic of China, examines its effects on the Chinese economy, surveys U.S. FDI in China, and includes a discussion of policy implications for the United States.  China, by far, is the largest recipient of FDI among emerging economies with an inflow of \\\\$52.7 billion in 2002 and 424,196 foreign-affiliated firms operating in China representing paid-in foreign investment of \\\\$448.0 billion.  These firms account for about half of China's exports and imports.  Nearly 1,500 U.S. companies from 41 states have direct investments of \\\\$10 to \\\\$34 billion in China.\\n For the U.S. Congress, foreign direct investment in China entails both oversight and regulatory issues.  Some questions with respect to this investment are: (1) the extent to which FDI is contributing to China's economic growth and technology development, (2) the extent to which U.S. FDI in China is contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, (3) whether FDI inflows into China come at the expense of flows into other countries, (4) how FDI is affecting security concerns, and (5) whether FDI affects the export of sensitive technology to China.\\n Foreign direct investment has contributed about 13 % to China's economic growth, and most of China's modern technology, particularly in electronics, has been imported.  With respect to trade, there is little doubt that the large surplus in China's trade has been generated largely by the surge in its exports of foreign brand-name manufactures often made in foreign-affiliated factories.  As much as 80 to 90% of certain high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firms there. In terms of the U.S. trade deficit with China, American companies there do export some of their output back to the American market, but most is sold in China.  China has been attracting some FDI flows that otherwise could have gone to other developing countries.  In essence, China's gain may be their loss.\\n In terms of security, the \\\\$20 to \\\\$34 billion in U.S. FDI in China combined with \\\\$68 billion from Taiwan, and some \\\\$300 billion from elsewhere is changing the calculus for hostilities and creating groups with a strong interest in stability both within China and between China and the United States, Taiwan, and other potential adversaries.  Foreign direct investment in China affects security primarily through three avenues: its contribution to economic power, economic interests, and technology transfers.  The more China grows, the more funds it is able to provide to its military and attain big-power status in the world.  With respect to economic interests, foreign companies in China can serve both as hostages for Beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue their interests in maintaining stability with both Beijing and their home governments.  With respect to sensitive technologies, in the U.S. case, it does not appear that prohibited U.S. technologies have been transferred through foreign affiliated companies, although the technologies in the electronics and aviation industries that have been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses.  Such transfers are controlled by export control regimes.  The highly publicized cases of satellite technology being allegedly illegally transferred to China involved direct transfers from U.S. corporations to Chinese companies. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant.\\n\\n  \\n \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n  \\n As the People's Republic of China (PRC) has opened its markets and sought to modernize its economy, it has relied partly on foreign direct investment (FDI) - investments by foreign entities in affiliated companies.   [\\\\[ (1)\\\\]](#n_1_) China, by far, is the largest recipient of FDI among emerging economies with \\\\$52.7 billion in FDI flowing into the country in 2002 (according to Chinese data).  China, moreover, is expecting FDI inflows to double over the second half of the decade.  [\\\\[ (2)\\\\]](#n_2_) As of December 2002, there were 424,196 foreign-affiliated firms operating in China (34,171 approved in 2002) representing paid-in foreign investment of \\\\$448.0 billion out of a contracted amount of \\\\$828.1 billion.  [\\\\[ (3)\\\\]](#n_3_) They account for about half of China's exports and imports.  U.S. companies have direct investments of \\\\$10 to \\\\$34 billion in China with nearly 1,500 firms whose headquarters are located in 41 different American states.  [\\\\[ (4)\\\\]](#n_4_)\\n For the U.S. Congress, foreign direct investment in China entails both oversight and regulatory issues.  Some questions with respect to this investment are: (1) the extent to which FDI is contributing to China's economic growth and technology development, (2) the extent to which U.S. FDI in China is contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, (3) whether FDI inflows into China come at the expense of flows into other countries, (4) how FDI is affecting security concerns, and (5) whether FDI affects the export of sensitive technology to China.\\n FDI has both direct and indirect effects on China's economic growth.  The indirect effects cannot be quantified, but they include demonstration effects (copying of processes, technology, and products by local businesses) and the easing of restrictions in various areas as Beijing gains experience in dealing with foreign businesses.  As for direct effects, it has been estimated that foreign investment has contributed about 13% [\\\\[ (5)\\\\]](#n_5_) to China's economic growth, and most of China's modern technology, particularly in electronics, has been imported.\\n With respect to trade, there is little doubt that the large surplus in China's trade has been generated by the surge in its exports of foreign brand-name manufactures often made in foreign-affiliated factories.  As much as 80 to 90% of China's high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firms there.  In the early period of liberalization, some foreign factories were allowed in the Chinese market only if they exported their output.  In terms of the U.S. trade deficit with China, American companies there do export some of their output back to the American market.  Most, however, is sold in China.  In 1998, of the \\\\$20 billion in total sales by U.S. majority-owned affiliates in China, 14% went to the United States, 69% was sold in China, and 17% went to other markets.  [\\\\[ (6)\\\\]](#n_6_) U.S. merchandise imports from and exports to majority-owned affiliates of American companies in China has been roughly in balance.\\n Other countries, both in Asia and elsewhere, have pointed out that China has been attracting FDI flows that otherwise could have come to their countries.  In essence, these economies view China's gain as their loss. Such concerns have been raised in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.  [\\\\[ (7)\\\\]](#n_7_) There is no doubt that China has attracted a rising share of world capital.  In 2002, China received over 85% of net direct investment in the Asia/Pacific region [\\\\[ (8)\\\\]](#n_8_) and has accounted for 20% of total FDI in developing economies.  Some investment in China could have been diverted from domestic investment in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.  Much of this investment, however, probably would have gone overseas anyway because of competitive pressures and rising labor costs and limited market expansion at home.  Countries, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, however, may have lost somewhat in the bidding war to attract foreign investment. The aftermath of the Asian financial crisis and domestic political instability in Indonesia, however, also have played a strong role.\\n In terms of security, the \\\\$10 to \\\\$34 billion in U.S. FDI in China combined with \\\\$68 billion from Taiwan, and some \\\\$300 billion from elsewhere is changing the likelihood that hostilities with China will erupt and creating groups with a strong interest in stability both within China and between China and the United States, Taiwan, and other potential adversaries.  Foreign direct investment in China affects security primarily through three avenues: its contribution to economic growth, technology transfers, and economic interests.  The more China grows, the more funds it is able to provide to its military and attain big-power status in the world.  In March 2002, China announced a 17.6% or \\\\$3 billion increase in spending, bringing the publicly reported total to \\\\$20 billion.  According to the U.S. Department of Defense, China's total military spending is closer to \\\\$65 billion, and annual spending could increase in real terms over three- to four-fold by 2020. [\\\\[ (9)\\\\]](#n_9_) FDI, however, contributes only indirectly to this military modernization.  With respect to economic interests, foreign companies in China may serve both as hostages for Beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue their interests in maintaining stability with both Beijing and their home governments.\\n With respect to sensitive technologies, in the U.S. case, it does not appear that prohibited U.S. technologies have been transferred through foreign affiliated companies, although the technologies in the electronics and aviation industries that have been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses.  Such transfers are controlled by export control regimes.  The highly publicized cases of satellite technology being allegedly illegally transferred to China involved direct transfers from U.S. corporations to Chinese companies.

       "    'text': '### South Africa in a Global Economic Context\\n While South Africa\\'s international competitiveness is hindered by the internal structure and dynamics of its economy, global market trends also strongly influence South Africa\\'s internal economic growth patterns.  According to the IMF, the export sector \"generates a significant amount of the wealth\" in the economy and \"facilitates the generation of value added in supporting industries and the provision of services. \" In recent years, two key external developments have posed significant economic challenges.  The 2008-2009 global financial crisis reportedly contributed to a 1.5% decrease in South Africa\\'s real GDP in 2009, although the economy largely recovered, growing to 3.6% by 2011, though it has since slowed.  The second, the European economic crisis, is seen as the reason for a drop in European demand for South African products, although a general rise in exports, most notably to China and Africa, has more than made up for that decline.  South African firms are also expanding their investments in Africa, particularly in banking, mining, and telecommunications.  , below.  provides information on the sectoral composition of the economy and summary trade trends.\\n\\n\\n Table 1.

FDI flows into South Africa have been variable but generally have risen since the early 1990s, peaking at just over \\\\$9 billion in 2008, but dropping moderately in recent years.  In 2012, FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from \\\\$6.04 billion in 2011 to \\\\$4.57 billion in 2012, when FDI stock stood at \\\\$138.96 billion.  In 2012 FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from \\\\$6.04 billion in 2011 to \\\\$4.57 billion in 2012, when FDI stock stood at \\\\$138.96 billion.  However, South African FDI outflows—investments abroad—also increased, from a negative \\\\$257 million in 2011 (compared to the previous year) to \\\\$4.37 billion in 2012, when South African foreign investments totaled \\\\$82.37 billion. [62] The World Bank\\'s annual *Doing Business* survey has found that South Africa is a relatively easy place to do business.  Its ranking under the survey, however, has gradually declined under the Zuma Administration, from 32 \\\\[nd\\\\] in 2009, when President Zuma took office, to 41 \\\\[st\\\\] in 2012, where it remained in 2014.  Key hindrances to FDI growth in recent years have reportedly included violent crime; corruption; Black Economic Empowerment regulation (see below); risks arising from political volatility in neighboring Zimbabwe; and South Africa\\'s own racial, class, and political divisions.\\n A proposed overhaul of South Africa\\'s investment framework, the Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill of 2013, has also raised concerns for some foreign investors.  With respect to FDI, it would replace the use of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with a new investment legal framework applicable to all investors.  In most cases, it would require investment disputes to be resolved by the South African legal system.  For some investors, this may raise questions over matters of alleged expropriation, compensation, national treatment, and rights of establishment, in addition to questions over dispute settlement.  To a large extent, the BIT aspects of the bill would not affect U.S. investors, as no U.S.-South African BIT is in force. [63]\\n In recent years, South Africa has sought an increased role in world economic fora and hosted a number of major global sporting events, such as the 2010 soccer World Cup, and multilateral policy events (e.g., the 2011 U.N. Climate Change Conference and the 2002 U.N. World Summit on Sustainable Development).  It is a member of the G20, and in late 2010, at the invitation of China, joined the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), a political and economic formation of major emerging market economies.  [64] South Africa is a key trading and investment partner of China in Africa, and a key target of increased Chinese economic and diplomatic cooperation over the past decade.  China became South Africa\\'s largest trading partner in 2009. (R43130(20))',\n",
       "    'summary': 'South Africa is a multi-racial, majority black southern African country of nearly 52 million. It held its first universal suffrage elections in 1994, after a transition from white minority rule under apartheid, a system of state-enforced racial segregation and socioeconomic discrimination. South Africa entered a period of mourning in late 2013, upon the death of its first post-apartheid president, Nelson Mandela. He is viewed as the founding father of the countrys nonracial democratic system, the 20th anniversary of which was recently celebrated prior to national elections on May 7. South Africa is influential regionally, due to its political, trade, and investment ties across Africa and its active role within the African Union. It is viewed as a U.S. strategic partner in Africa, despite periodic foreign policy differences. In mid-2013, President Obama traveled to South Africa, among other African countries. Key issues addressed in South Africa included bilateral political and trade and investment ties, development cooperation, and shared U.S.-South African aims regarding similar issues across Africa, as well as democracy, youth leadership development, and peace and security.\\nCongress has long been engaged with South Africa, notably during the anti-apartheid struggle, and with regard to post-apartheid socioeconomic development efforts, a key focus of bilateral ties. Since 1992, South Africa has been a leading recipient of U.S. foreign aid, mostly devoted to addressing HIV/AIDS and other health challenges. Aid oversight has drawn the bulk of South Africa-related congressional attention in recent years. U.S. policy makers are also increasingly focused on efforts to strengthen already growing U.S.-South African trade and investment ties. Other key areas of bilateral engagement include security cooperation and an ongoing U.S.-South African Strategic Dialogue. Established in 2010, the Dialogue centers on health, education, food security, law enforcement, trade, investment, and energy, among other issues.\\nSouth Africa has the largest, most diversified, and highly industrialized economy in Africa. It has enjoyed moderate economic growth in most recent years. Average per capita incomes and access to education have grown across racial groups, notably for blacks. Despite post-apartheid national socioeconomic gains, South Africa remains a highly unequal society with respect to wealth and income distribution and access to jobs, social services, utilities, and land. Most blacks are poor, and average black incomes are far smaller than those of the historically privileged white minority.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked South Africa as the second most competitive sub- Saharan African economy in 2019 (after Mauritius), but assessed it as 60th globally.  The WEF cited as economic strengths South Africa’s large market size, relatively good infrastructure, advanced financial system, and innovation capability, but described its research and development capacities as inadequate.103  The country’s score on the World Bank *Doing Business* index (82nd globally and fourth in Africa in 2019) have dropped over the past decade.  The survey suggested that ease of doing business varies within sub-regions of the country.104  South Africa’s private sector is relatively dynamic, although firms face a highly unionized labor force, rigid labor laws and, in some industries, sector-wide wage and working condition agreements negotiated between large firms and unions.  Such factors arguably tend to protect incumbent jobholders, reduce labor market flexibility, and limit formal sector economic opportunities for the unemployed and poor, and contribute to chronically high unemployment.  South Africa first enacted a general minimum wage law in 2018.  105 Oligopolies in some sectors also hinder competition and spur high prices for some locally produced goods.106 There are also skill and geographical mismatches between labor demand and supplies, and low skill levels in some segments of the labor force. This is, in part, an enduring legacy of population and economic controls and discriminatory education and training patterns under apartheid. Information and communication (ICT) adoption rates also are low and uneven, and education quality ranks poorly in international comparisons, despite large investments in the sector, which has negative impacts on workforce capabilities.107  Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies, which seek to promote racial equality and economic inclusion using market-based incentives, are a key tool for reversing structural racial disparities.  Private firms that receive public contracts must comply with BEE requirements, notably a scorecard-based system.

The country is a famed wine producer and exports a range of agricultural products, such as wool, maize, sugar, and fruit and juice, although only about 10% of its land is arable and agriculture contributes less than 3% of the GDP. Industrial contributions to GDP, at 28.4% in 2012, are far more significant. South Africa is the world\\'s leading producer of platinum and chromium and a major gold, diamond, and coal producer. Other key industrial sectors include automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, foodstuffs, and iron and steel production. Services contribute the largest share of GDP, 69%.  South Africa has large and well-developed tourism, banking, energy, legal, communications, and transport sectors. South African cell phone companies and other firms are active throughout Africa, and SABMiller, formerly South African Breweries, operates globally. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is among the 20 largest exchanges globally, and South Africa is one of the few African upper middle income countries (defined by the World Bank as those with a per capita gross national income of $4,086-$12,615 in 2012).\\n Domestically, South Africa faces a number of economic challenges. Low local savings rates mean that South African firms seeking credit must often turn to foreign sources of finance. Government deficits have increased in recent years, from an average of 0.5% of GDP from 2005 to 2008 to an average of nearly 5% of GDP from 2009 to 2012, and government net debt as a percent of GDP has grown from a low of about 23% in 2008 to over 34% in 2012. Total external debt stocks have risen steadily, from $68 billion in 2008 to nearly $114 billion in 2011.  Due to population increases, real per capita GDP growth has also lagged behind national GDP growth rates.\\n An inadequately educated workforce is widely seen as a key hindrance to growth. Education quality in South Africa ranks poorly in international comparisons, despite large investments in the sector.  High unemployment, limited access to social services, and diverse public infrastructure investment needs are also viewed as key barriers to economic growth. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), distortions of demand, supply, and pricing in the labor market, together with other market imbalances, have undermined South Africa\\'s economic production potential and helped \"to preserv inequality and high unemployment. \"  Despite efforts to increase electricity generation capacity, lack of power is another serious problem. (R43130(19))\\n=======\\n**RL31697:** South Africa: Current Issues and U.S. Relations\\n## Background\\n The people of South Africa are highly diverse. Black Africans make up more than three-quarters of the population, but come from several different ethnic backgrounds. Most whites are Afrikaans speakers of Dutch, German, and French Huguenot ancestry, but there is a substantial English-speaking white minority. The remainder of the population are Asian, largely of Indian descent, and people of mixed race.\\n South Africa\\'s economy, the largest on the continent, is diverse as well. South Africa produces wine, wool, maize and other agricultural products for export, although only about 12% of the country\\'s land is suitable for agriculture. Moreover, South Africa is the world\\'s leading producer of gold, platinum, and chromium. Major industrial sectors include automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, foodstuffs, and iron and steel production. South African cell phone companies and other firms are active throughout Africa, and SABMiller, formerly South African Breweries, operates on a global scale. The country\\'s stock exchange is among the 20 largest in the world, and South Africa is one of the few countries on the continent to rank as an upper middle income country. Despite its many economic strengths, however, the country ranks as one of the most unequal societies in the world in terms of income distribution. The majority of black South Africans live in poverty, and South Africa\\'s cities are surrounded by vast informal housing settlements known as \"townships.\" Shortages of water, electricity, and other social services in the townships have contributed to growing tensions, as evidenced by a rise in township protests in recent years.\\n South Africa is an influential actor in the international relations of Africa. South Africa served from 2007 through 2008 as one of the 10 non-permanent members of the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council; it has been elected to serve another two-year term beginning in January 2011. The country remains a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council. Its voting record on both bodies has been considered by some to be controversial. South Africa was a founding member of the African Union (AU), successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and then-President Thabo Mbeki served as the AU\\'s first chairperson. President Mbeki also took a lead role in the creation of the New Partnership for Africa\\'s Development (NEPAD), an African-designed plan for improved governance within Africa and increased western aid, trade, and investment that was adopted by the AU as a blueprint for the continent\\'s economic development. South Africa has repeatedly put itself forward as a venue for major international conferences, such as the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, the 2001 World Conference on Racism. In 2010, South Africa was the first African nation to host the soccer World Cup, and in December 2011, the country will host the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. South Africa is the only African member of the G20, the premier forum for international economic cooperation.\\n Weak regimes and instability elsewhere in the region have historically had a negative impact on South Africa, and the country continues to face a large influx of illegal immigrants. By some estimates, more than three million Zimbabweans currently reside illegally in South Africa. Some South Africans blame these immigrants for the country\\'s high crime and unemployment rates, and in May 2008 tensions erupted in the townships, sparking a wave of xenophobic attacks that displaced over 25,000 and left over 60 dead. Isolated attacks have occurred since then, and the potential for further violence cannot be ruled out.\\n In order to promote greater stability, South African officials have played prominent mediator roles in African conflicts, and South African troops actively support peacekeeping missions throughout the continent. In 2002, they helped to persuade the parties to the prolonged conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to sign a peace agreement following negotiations in South Africa. President Thabo Mbeki was less successful in mediating the conflict in Cote d\\'Ivoire, a country which continues to face political turmoil. Former President Nelson Mandela played a leading role in brokering a peace agreement in Burundi, and South Africa contributed hundreds of troops to the peacekeeping mission there. Over 1,200 South African troops are currently participating as peacekeepers in the U.N. Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO), and over 900 South African soldiers and police serve under the U.N.-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). In a move believed by many to protest the Sudanese government\\'s policies in Darfur, the Mbeki government was instrumental in preventing Sudan from attaining the chairmanship of the African Union in 2006. It has, however, protested the imposition of tougher U.N. sanctions against Sudan and an International Criminal Court (ICC) indictment of Sudanese President Omar al Bashir as counterproductive.  Former President Mbeki continues to play an active mediation role in Sudan. The country has supported democratic advances on the continent, providing millions of ballots in 2006 for elections in the DRC. In 2007, the heads of state of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) nominated then-President Mbeki as mediator between the Zimbabwean government and the opposition in an effort to resolve its political and economic crises. Mbeki\\'s role was controversial. President Jacob Zuma and a team of his own mediators took over in late 2009.

Shares of Income Before and After Taxes and Means-Tested## Summary\\n Over the 1979-2018 period, real wages at the 10  percentile of the hourly wage distribution grew by 1.6%, whereas wages at the 50  percentile grew by 6.1% and wages at the 90  percentile grew by 37.6%. These patterns varied by sex, race, and ethnicity. Most of the increase in wage inequality at the bottom of the distribution occurred by 1990 and leveled off by 2000, whereas inequality continued to grow at the top of the distribution after 2000. Lower wages are associated with less education, and the college wage premium (the ratio of earnings of those with a college degree over those with a high school degree) grew steeply until 2000. The labor income share of compensation has declined beginning around 2000. Both the growth in hourly wage inequality and the decline in the labor share of compensation contributed to greater inequality of before-tax income. From 1979 to 2017, the income share of the bottom quintile fell from 5.3% to 3.5%, whereas the share of the top quintile rose from 41.9% to 50.1%.\\n Several factors potentially contributed to this change in wage inequality: technological advancement, globalization, wage-setting institutional changes (i.e., the minimum wage, presence of labor unions, and decline in the large firm wage premium), immigration, and declines in job mobility, across jobs in general and geographically.\\n A review of the economic research suggests that a major force in causing this growing wage inequality and lower wage growth was skill-based technological change (change increasing the demand for skilled over unskilled workers). Although there is mixed evidence, most studies find a smaller, modest effect of globalization (although trade affects locations and sectors differently). The minimum wage appeared to play a relatively small role. The decline in wages has coincided with the decline in unions, but to some extent, the decline in unions was a consequence of the decline in jobs in heavily unionized sectors due to technological advancement. Given the size of the decline and the union wage premium, as well as tracing some of the decline to technology, unionization appears to be of limited importance. The decline in the wage premium for large firms may also be traced to increased competition from technological advancement and globalization. Evidence also indicates that immigration had little effect on the distribution of wages, but resulted in a slight increase in inequality because immigrants are concentrated at the upper and lower ends of the income distribution. A decline in labor force mobility has occurred in recent years and could have contributed in some way to inequality.\\n Because the causes of the wage stagnation and growth inequality appear to be traceable largely to technological change, which is otherwise valued, other policies might be considered to increase the well-being of workers whose wages have stagnated. One policy option is to either increase transfers, including those provided through the tax structure, such as the earned income tax credit. Childless workers, in particular, have small earned income credits. Another option is to increase the federal minimum wage, although states are gradually undertaking these increases. A more far-reaching policy option is a federally guaranteed job. Proposals have also been made to expand wage insurance, which currently is available to only a narrow group of trade-affected workers. Policies to increase skill acquisition, including a greatly expanded apprenticeship program, could be considered, although they would have delayed effects on inequality. A variety of policies have been advanced to strengthen unions. In addition, a number of policies might be considered to increase labor mobility. Finally, a variety of geographically targeted provisions aimed particularly at increasing employment in chronically high unemployment areas could be considered. Transfers, including the earned income credit, have improved the distribution of after-tax income, but some other policies have a less successful track record, and some (such as a guaranteed job) are untried.\\n \\n \\n The stagnation of real hourly wages at the lower end of the income distribution, where workers tend to be less educated, has entered into the policy debate over many issues, including trade, immigration, and institutional factors such as the minimum wage. This lack of wage growth has also contributed to an increase in overall income inequality. The first section reviews changes in the distribution of hourly wages (as well as considering the effects of fringe benefits) and overall income. Following that review, the report reviews the evidence on the main factors that might have contributed to this lack of wage growth, including technological advancement, trade, the minimum wage, unions, the large firm wage premium, immigration, and reduced labor mobility. The final section of the report explores policy options that might be considered by Congress.

Such investments support infrastructure construction, job skills training, public works and service jobs, and selected private sector projects determined to have the potential to increase employment and enhance economic productivity. In late 2010, the Zuma Administration launched a medium-term growth strategy, the *New Growth Path*. Its centerpiece is an industrial policy aimed at expanding economic output, creating 5 million new jobs, and reducing unemployment from 25% to 15% by 2020. It targets large public infrastructure investments in five key areas: energy, transport, communication, water, and housing. It also funds investment and human resource development programs aimed at increasing jobs and output in the \"green economy\" (solar, wind, and biofuels industries); agriculture; manufacturing; tourism and other services; and mining. It calls for the creation of a state mining firm focused on value-added processing and \"enhanced resource exploitation in competition with a strong private mining sector. \" It also calls for state fiscal discipline and emphasizes diverse roles for the private sector. Some aspects of the new strategy, including proposals to cap wages and bonuses, have met with objections from unions and from business interests, which fear that private sector pay bonus caps may deter FDI.\\n Spending on such infrastructure and capital investment projects, along with institution capacity-building projects, is forecast to total about $97 billion over the next three years and $600 billion over the next decade. Increasing public expenditures are reflected in South Africa\\'s first-ever trillion-plus Rand (about $150 billion) budget in its 2012/2013 budget year. The government has also suggested that it may expand the role of state development finance institutions in funding its agenda, although most spending is set to come from state agencies\\' operating capital and 30% from the open market. This agenda has left private industry unsure of its role in the government\\'s plans and has led business interest groups to call for the creation of infrastructure-focused public-private partnerships. Critics have also questioned whether state agencies and parastatals (partially or wholly publicly owned commercial entities) are up to the job, in light of factors such as massive state project delays, cost overruns, and failures to expend funding allocated for infrastructure construction.  State efforts to access financing to fund public investments could be hindered by labor unrest and corruption. In late 2012, these factors helped spur country economic risk rating downgrades or warnings (e.g., by Moody\\'s, Standard and Poor\\'s, and Fitch), which may make public investment financing more expensive, and potentially prompt the government to seek funding from international financial institutions or non-Western lenders, such as China.\\n South Africa\\'s public spending is creating significant market opportunities for U.S. business backed by U.S. public export financing assistance, notably the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im). It financed several large deals in South Africa in 2011 and 2012, including two rail locomotive manufacturing deals involving GE Transportation, a U.S. firm, and South African rails parastatals. In 2011, Ex-Im approved an $805.6 million direct loan to help finance a major expansion of a large coal fired power plant run by South Africa\\'s state electricity utility. In 2012, Ex-Im signed an agreement of intent to provide financing for South African purchases of up to $2 billion in U.S. technologies, products, and services, most related to clean energy production and South African government infrastructure construction initiatives.  (R43130(21))\\n## Key Policies to Increase Economic Equality\\n Since 1994, successive post-apartheid governments have pursued two major efforts to increase racial economic equality. One, known as Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), seeks to promote the increased participation of blacks throughout the South African economy, a process dubbed \"transformation.\" The other, land reform (a set of inter-related policies), seeks to increase black land ownership, among other goals. (R43130(22))\\n### Black Economic Empowerment\\n BEE policies primarily seek to increase access to jobs by blacks and certain other marginalized groups in all occupational categories and levels of employment, and to increase rates of ownership and management of firms and other types of productive entities by these groups. Initial BEE efforts prioritized business ownership transfers to blacks, as well as preferential black access to corporate leadership positions, leading to criticisms that BEE was creating a privileged black class rather than achieving broad black \"economic empowerment.\"  To address such criticisms, current BEE policies more heavily emphasize efforts to advance racial employment equity, and to provide job training and other skills development services to blacks and other BEE beneficiaries.\\n Implementation of BEE goals is mandatory for public entities. The government promotes private sector investment in BEE goals by working with industries to set up sector-specific transformation best practice \"charters\" and \"sector codes,\" but the main tool for fostering attainment of BEE goals is BEE scorecards, which assess a business\\'s attainment of a range of benchmarks. BEE scorecards are used as eligibility criteria in public procurement, some forms of licensing, participation in public-private partnership deals and transactions (e.g., sales of state-owned assets), tax preferences, public company stock listings, and other matters of economic concern to firms. Higher scores can be attained if a firm\\'s suppliers meet BEE goals, a measure aimed at using business demand to drive private sector adoption of BEE policies. There are some exemptions from BEE policies for small firms. For larger and more complex firms, BEE compliance is highly legalistic and is accompanied by paperwork-intensive reporting requirements.  In June 2013, the government introduced a BEE amendment bill that would create a range of BEE policy implementation monitoring, oversight, and advocacy measures and mechanisms and introduce new offenses and penalties for scorecard misrepresentation.

(R43130(23))\\n=======\\n**RL31697:** South Africa: Current Issues and U.S. Relations\\n## The Economy\\n In 2009, South Africa weathered its first recession in 17 years. The rate of growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged 3% per year in the first decade after apartheid and rose to an average of 5% from 2004 to 2007. The growth rate fell to 3.7% in 2008 and -1.8% in 2009, due in part to the global economic downturn; it rose to an estimated 2.8% in 2010. The growth rate is expected to rise to 3.7% in 2011.  Much higher rates will be needed if South Africa is to substantially increase employment among the black majority and reduce the sharp inequalities in income distribution among the races. Unemployment estimates range from 25% to 40%, far above the government\\'s target of 15%. The vast, poverty-stricken townships surrounding South Africa\\'s cities remain a potential source of political instability. In recent years periodic riots have erupted in several poor municipalities to protest local government corruption and inadequate service delivery. Although turnout and support for the ANC remained high nationally in the country\\'s last nationwide municipal elections, voters boycotted the polls in a number of townships in which the ANC had formerly enjoyed strong support, and several hundred former ANC supporters stood as independent candidates. Conditions in the townships have improved marginally with the expanded availability of electricity and the provision of clean water taps. However, the widening gap between the rich and poor is likely to pose a continuing challenge. (RL31697(18))\\n### Economic Policies Under Thabo Mbeki\\n South Africa won praise from international economists for its reform-oriented macro-economic policy in the late 1990s, which, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, \"demonstrated its commitment to open markets, privatization, and a favorable investment climate, moving away from the former government\\'s strategy of import substitution and industrial development that protected local industries with high tariff barriers. \"  The policy, known as the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, delivered mixed results—it engendered macroeconomic stability, fiscal discipline, and trade liberalization. However, unemployment continued to rise, and income distribution remained highly skewed, largely along racial lines. Nevertheless, the income of the average black household almost doubled in the first decade after the end of apartheid. In late 2007, the government announced that the average national income had risen 22% since 1999. \\n In 2005, the government unveiled a new economic plan, the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA). It was designed to raise the economic growth rate to 4.5% from 2004-2009 and to at least 6% from 2010-1014 through targeted interventions, including public investment in infrastructure, and to cut unemployment rates in half by 2014. These targets, optimistic prior to the economic downturn, are likely now unattainable in the near term.\\n Some economists attribute South Africa\\'s economic difficulties, in part, to the slow pace of privatization. Despite its commitment to privatization, the Mbeki government remained heavily involved in transportation, communications, energy production, and the defense sector, and after the 2004 elections expressed a desire to restructure most remaining state-owned enterprises rather than expand privatization. Further privatization delays were due in part to government concerns that privatization would boost unemployment temporarily, fueling criticism from COSATU and the SACP. According to COSATU and SACP, the job cutbacks that often follow privatization are contributing to the country\\'s unemployment and growing income gap. (RL31697(19))\\n### Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)\\n The government has sought to promote \"black empowerment\" by assuring that a significant portion of the shares in privatized companies would be acquired by black South Africans rather than by wealthy whites or foreign investors. Its Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) program, initiated in 1994, was designed to address racial inequalities in the business sector. In 1994, blacks owned less than 5% of the country\\'s private enterprises. As of 2008, there were over 15 black-owned and 29 black-empowered companies listed on the South African stock exchange. The rise in black ownership has been echoed by a significant increase in the black middle class. Nevertheless, the lack of skilled labor may be hampering the program, as may complicated or unclear regulations. In 2007, the government instituted the BEE Codes of Good Practice, which make both listed and unlisted companies subject to empowerment requirements and targets, but offer concessions to small businesses and foreign investors.  A new economic growth strategy introduced by the government in November 2010 (see below) proposes a \"major re-think\" and \"substantial revision\" of the BEE codes to increase jobs, skills development, and investment. (RL31697(20))\\n### Foreign Investment\\n In the first decade of post-apartheid rule, analysts expressed concern over the government\\'s ability to attract foreign investment at the levels needed to spur growth. Sound macroeconomic policies, including reduced tariffs and export subsidies, the loosening of exchange controls, improved enforcement of intellectual property laws, and legislation designed to improve competition have been cited by observers as responsible for the country\\'s economic growth. A World Bank study finds that South Africa is one of the top 35 easiest countries in which to do business.  Investors are, however, reportedly worried by labor relations, high crime rates, and corruption. Transparency International ranks South Africa 54 out of 178 in its 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating that it is perceived as less corrupt than other Sub-Saharan African countries (only four African countries ranked less corrupt than South Africa), but more corrupt than many competitors for investment in other parts of the world.  Its ranking has fallen from 43 in 2007. Political risks arising from potential instability in Zimbabwe are regarded as another deterrent to investors, and South Africa\\'s own racial, class, and political divisions are seen as sources of concern. Analysts have also highlighted the country\\'s executive \"brain drain\" as one of the greatest threats to South Africa\\'s economic progress.

According to the IMF, the export sector \"generates a significant amount of the wealth\" in the economy and \"facilitates the generation of value added in supporting industries and the provision of services. \" In recent years, two key external developments have posed significant economic challenges. The 2008-2009 global financial crisis reportedly contributed to a 1.5% decrease in South Africa\\'s real GDP in 2009, although the economy largely recovered, growing to 3.6% by 2011, though it has since slowed. The second, the European economic crisis, is seen as the reason for a drop in European demand for South African products, although a general rise in exports, most notably to China and Africa, has more than made up for that decline.

FDI flows into South Africa have been variable but generally have risen since the early 1990s, peaking at just over $9 billion in 2008, but dropping moderately in recent years. In 2012, FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from $6.04 billion in 2011 to $4.57 billion in 2012, when FDI stock stood at $138.96 billion. In 2012 FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from $6.04 billion in 2011 to $4.57 billion in 2012, when FDI stock stood at $138.96 billion. However, South African FDI outflows—investments abroad—also increased, from a negative $257 million in 2011 (compared to the previous year) to $4.37 billion in 2012, when South African foreign investments totaled $82.37 billion.  The World Bank\\'s annual *Doing Business* survey has found that South Africa is a relatively easy place to do business. Its ranking under the survey, however, has gradually declined under the Zuma Administration, from 32  in 2009, when President Zuma took office, to 41  in 2012, where it remained in 2014. Key hindrances to FDI growth in recent years have reportedly included violent crime; corruption; Black Economic Empowerment regulation (see below); risks arising from political volatility in neighboring Zimbabwe; and South Africa\\'s own racial, class, and political divisions.\\n A proposed overhaul of South Africa\\'s investment framework, the Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill of 2013, has also raised concerns for some foreign investors. With respect to FDI, it would replace the use of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with a new investment legal framework applicable to all investors. In most cases, it would require investment disputes to be resolved by the South African legal system. For some investors, this may raise questions over matters of alleged expropriation, compensation, national treatment, and rights of establishment, in addition to questions over dispute settlement. To a large extent, the BIT aspects of the bill would not affect U.S. investors, as no U.S.-South African BIT is in force. \\n In recent years, South Africa has sought an increased role in world economic fora and hosted a number of major global sporting events, such as the 2010 soccer World Cup, and multilateral policy events (e.g., the 2011 U.N. Climate Change Conference and the 2002 U.N. World Summit on Sustainable Development). It is a member of the G20, and in late 2010, at the invitation of China, joined the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), a political and economic formation of major emerging market economies.  South Africa is a key trading and investment partner of China in Africa, and a key target of increased Chinese economic and diplomatic cooperation over the past decade. China became South Africa\\'s largest trading partner in 2009. (R43130(20))\\n=======\\n**RL31749:** Foreign Direct Investment in China\\n### Summary\\n This report provides an overview of global Foreign Direct Investment in the People\\'s Republic of China, examines its effects on the Chinese economy, surveys U.S. FDI in China, and includes a discussion of policy implications for the United States. China, by far, is the largest recipient of FDI among emerging economies with an inflow of $52.7 billion in 2002 and 424,196 foreign-affiliated firms operating in China representing paid-in foreign investment of $448.0 billion. These firms account for about half of China\\'s exports and imports. Nearly 1,500 U.S. companies from 41 states have direct investments of $10 to $34 billion in China.\\n For the U.S. Congress, foreign direct investment in China entails both oversight and regulatory issues. Some questions with respect to this investment are: (1) the extent to which FDI is contributing to China\\'s economic growth and technology development, (2) the extent to which U.S. FDI in China is contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, (3) whether FDI inflows into China come at the expense of flows into other countries, (4) how FDI is affecting security concerns, and (5) whether FDI affects the export of sensitive technology to China.\\n Foreign direct investment has contributed about 13 % to China\\'s economic growth, and most of China\\'s modern technology, particularly in electronics, has been imported. With respect to trade, there is little doubt that the large surplus in China\\'s trade has been generated largely by the surge in its exports of foreign brand-name manufactures often made in foreign-affiliated factories. As much as 80 to 90% of certain high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firms there. In terms of the U.S. trade deficit with China, American companies there do export some of their output back to the American market, but most is sold in China. China has been attracting some FDI flows that otherwise could have gone to other developing countries. In essence, China\\'s gain may be their loss.\\n In terms of security, the $20 to $34 billion in U.S. FDI in China combined with $68 billion from Taiwan, and some $300 billion from elsewhere is changing the calculus for hostilities and creating groups with a strong interest in stability both within China and between China and the United States, Taiwan, and other potential adversaries. Foreign direct investment in China affects security primarily through three avenues: its contribution to economic power, economic interests, and technology transfers. The more China grows, the more funds it is able to provide to its military and attain big-power status in the world. With respect to economic interests, foreign companies in China can serve both as hostages for Beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue their interests in maintaining stability with both Beijing and their home governments. With respect to sensitive technologies, in the U.S. case, it does not appear that prohibited U.S. technologies have been transferred through foreign affiliated companies, although the technologies in the electronics and aviation industries that have been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses. Such transfers are controlled by export control regimes. The highly publicized cases of satellite technology being allegedly illegally transferred to China involved direct transfers from U.S. corporations to Chinese companies. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant.\\n \\n \\n \\n As the People\\'s Republic of China (PRC) has opened its markets and sought to modernize its economy, it has relied partly on foreign direct investment (FDI) - investments by foreign entities in affiliated companies. ](#n_1_) China, by far, is the largest recipient of FDI among emerging economies with $52.7 billion in FDI flowing into the country in 2002 (according to Chinese data). China, moreover, is expecting FDI inflows to double over the second half of the decade. ](#n_2_) As of December 2002, there were 424,196 foreign-affiliated firms operating in China (34,171 approved in 2002) representing paid-in foreign investment of $448.0 billion out of a contracted amount of $828.1 billion. ](#n_3_) They account for about half of China\\'s exports and imports. U.S. companies have direct investments of $10 to $34 billion in China with nearly 1,500 firms whose headquarters are located in 41 different American states. ](#n_4_)\\n For the U.S. Congress, foreign direct investment in China entails both oversight and regulatory issues. Some questions with respect to this investment are: (1) the extent to which FDI is contributing to China\\'s economic growth and technology development, (2) the extent to which U.S. FDI in China is contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, (3) whether FDI inflows into China come at the expense of flows into other countries, (4) how FDI is affecting security concerns, and (5) whether FDI affects the export of sensitive technology to China.\\n FDI has both direct and indirect effects on China\\'s economic growth. The indirect effects cannot be quantified, but they include demonstration effects (copying of processes, technology, and products by local businesses) and the easing of restrictions in various areas as Beijing gains experience in dealing with foreign businesses. As for direct effects, it has been estimated that foreign investment has contributed about 13% ](#n_5_) to China\\'s economic growth, and most of China\\'s modern technology, particularly in electronics, has been imported.\\n With respect to trade, there is little doubt that the large surplus in China\\'s trade has been generated by the surge in its exports of foreign brand-name manufactures often made in foreign-affiliated factories. As much as 80 to 90% of China\\'s high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firms there. In the early period of liberalization, some foreign factories were allowed in the Chinese market only if they exported their output. In terms of the U.S. trade deficit with China, American companies there do export some of their output back to the American market. Most, however, is sold in China. In 1998, of the $20 billion in total sales by U.S. majority-owned affiliates in China, 14% went to the United States, 69% was sold in China, and 17% went to other markets. ](#n_6_) U.S. merchandise imports from and exports to majority-owned affiliates of American companies in China has been roughly in balance.\\n Other countries, both in Asia and elsewhere, have pointed out that China has been attracting FDI flows that otherwise could have come to their countries. In essence, these economies view China\\'s gain as their loss. Such concerns have been raised in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. ](#n_7_) There is no doubt that China has attracted a rising share of world capital. In 2002, China received over 85% of net direct investment in the Asia/Pacific region ](#n_8_) and has accounted for 20% of total FDI in developing economies. Some investment in China could have been diverted from domestic investment in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. Much of this investment, however, probably would have gone overseas anyway because of competitive pressures and rising labor costs and limited market expansion at home. Countries, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, however, may have lost somewhat in the bidding war to attract foreign investment. The aftermath of the Asian financial crisis and domestic political instability in Indonesia, however, also have played a strong role.\\n In terms of security, the $10 to $34 billion in U.S. FDI in China combined with $68 billion from Taiwan, and some $300 billion from elsewhere is changing the likelihood that hostilities with China will erupt and creating groups with a strong interest in stability both within China and between China and the United States, Taiwan, and other potential adversaries. Foreign direct investment in China affects security primarily through three avenues: its contribution to economic growth, technology transfers, and economic interests. The more China grows, the more funds it is able to provide to its military and attain big-power status in the world. In March 2002, China announced a 17.6% or $3 billion increase in spending, bringing the publicly reported total to $20 billion. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, China\\'s total military spending is closer to $65 billion, and annual spending could increase in real terms over three- to four-fold by 2020. ](#n_9_) FDI, however, contributes only indirectly to this military modernization. With respect to economic interests, foreign companies in China may serve both as hostages for Beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue their interests in maintaining stability with both Beijing and their home governments.\\n With respect to sensitive technologies, in the U.S. case, it does not appear that prohibited U.S. technologies have been transferred through foreign affiliated companies, although the technologies in the electronics and aviation industries that have been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses. Such transfers are controlled by export control regimes. The highly publicized cases of satellite technology being allegedly illegally transferred to China involved direct transfers from U.S. corporations to Chinese companies. ](#n_10_) (RL31749(3))\\n=======\\n**R45687:** South Africa: Current Issues, Economy, and U.S. Relations\\n*South Africa: Current Issues, Economy, and U.S. Relations* **Indicator** **2014** **2015** **2016** **2017** **2018** **Value as % of GDP** 33 31.5 30.1 28.3 29.6 **Total Trade in Goods and Services** **Exports and Imports, Current $ in** 225.9 195.6 179.7 202.5 219.0 **billions** **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI; $ in billions)** **Inflows (to South Africa)** 5.8 1.7 2.2 2.0 5.3 **Inward Stocks (FDI in South Africa)** 138.9 126.8 135.5 156.1 128.8 **Outflows (South African FDI abroad)** 7.7 5.7 4.5 7.4 4.6 **Outward Stocks (South African FDI** 146.0 154.7 175.6 276.5 238.0 **abroad)** **Sources:** Trade date: World Bank, World Development Indicators database.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked South Africa as the second most competitive sub- Saharan African economy in 2019 (after Mauritius), but assessed it as 60th globally. The WEF cited as economic strengths South Africa’s large market size, relatively good infrastructure, advanced financial system, and innovation capability, but described its research and development capacities as inadequate.103 The country’s score on the World Bank *Doing Business* index (82nd globally and fourth in Africa in 2019) have dropped over the past decade. The survey suggested that ease of doing business varies within sub-regions of the country.104 South Africa’s private sector is relatively dynamic, although firms face a highly unionized labor force, rigid labor laws and, in some industries, sector-wide wage and working condition agreements negotiated between large firms and unions. Such factors arguably tend to protect incumbent jobholders, reduce labor market flexibility, and limit formal sector economic opportunities for the unemployed and poor, and contribute to chronically high unemployment. South Africa first enacted a general minimum wage law in 2018. 105 Oligopolies in some sectors also hinder competition and spur high prices for some locally produced goods.106 There are also skill and geographical mismatches between labor demand and supplies, and low skill levels in some segments of the labor force. This is, in part, an enduring legacy of population and economic controls and discriminatory education and training patterns under apartheid. Information and communication (ICT) adoption rates also are low and uneven, and education quality ranks poorly in international comparisons, despite large investments in the sector, which has negative impacts on workforce capabilities.107 Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies, which seek to promote racial equality and economic inclusion using market-based incentives, are a key tool for reversing structural racial disparities. Private firms that receive public contracts must comply with BEE requirements, notably a scorecard-based system. It ranks firms by factors such as racially inclusive ownership 103 WEF, *The Global Competitiveness Report 2019* and *The Global Competitiveness Report 2018.* 104 World Bank, *Doing Business in South Africa 2018*, September 19, 2018, and “South Africa” Doing Business country profile, October 31, 2017. 105 The minimum wage is R20 per hour or R3,500 a month ($1.19 or $209 as of mid-July 2020).

       "   'text': '## The Economy\\n In 2009, South Africa weathered its first recession in 17 years.  The rate of growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged 3% per year in the first decade after apartheid and rose to an average of 5% from 2004 to 2007.  The growth rate fell to 3.7% in 2008 and -1.8% in 2009, due in part to the global economic downturn; it rose to an estimated 2.8% in 2010.  The growth rate is expected to rise to 3.7% in 2011. [46] Much higher rates will be needed if South Africa is to substantially increase employment among the black majority and reduce the sharp inequalities in income distribution among the races.  Unemployment estimates range from 25% to 40%, far above the government\\'s target of 15%.  The vast, poverty-stricken townships surrounding South Africa\\'s cities remain a potential source of political instability.  In recent years periodic riots have erupted in several poor municipalities to protest local government corruption and inadequate service delivery.  Although turnout and support for the ANC remained high nationally in the country\\'s last nationwide municipal elections, voters boycotted the polls in a number of townships in which the ANC had formerly enjoyed strong support, and several hundred former ANC supporters stood as independent candidates.  Conditions in the townships have improved marginally with the expanded availability of electricity and the provision of clean water taps.  However, the widening gap between the rich and poor is likely to pose a continuing challenge. (RL31697(18))\\n### Economic Policies Under Thabo Mbeki\\n South Africa won praise from international economists for its reform-oriented macro-economic policy in the late 1990s, which, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, \"demonstrated its commitment to open markets, privatization, and a favorable investment climate, moving away from the former government\\'s strategy of import substitution and industrial development that protected local industries with high tariff barriers. \" [47] The policy, known as the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, delivered mixed results—it engendered macroeconomic stability, fiscal discipline, and trade liberalization.  However, unemployment continued to rise, and income distribution remained highly skewed, largely along racial lines.  Nevertheless, the income of the average black household almost doubled in the first decade after the end of apartheid.  In late 2007, the government announced that the average national income had risen 22% since 1999. [48]\\n In 2005, the government unveiled a new economic plan, the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA).  It was designed to raise the economic growth rate to 4.5% from 2004-2009 and to at least 6% from 2010-1014 through targeted interventions, including public investment in infrastructure, and to cut unemployment rates in half by 2014.  These targets, optimistic prior to the economic downturn, are likely now unattainable in the near term.\\n Some economists attribute South Africa\\'s economic difficulties, in part, to the slow pace of privatization.  Despite its commitment to privatization, the Mbeki government remained heavily involved in transportation, communications, energy production, and the defense sector, and after the 2004 elections expressed a desire to restructure most remaining state-owned enterprises rather than expand privatization. Further privatization delays were due in part to government concerns that privatization would boost unemployment temporarily, fueling criticism from COSATU and the SACP.  According to COSATU and SACP, the job cutbacks that often follow privatization are contributing to the country\\'s unemployment and growing income gap. (RL31697(19))\\n### Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)\\n The government has sought to promote \"black empowerment\" by assuring that a significant portion of the shares in privatized companies would be acquired by black South Africans rather than by wealthy whites or foreign investors.  Its Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) program, initiated in 1994, was designed to address racial inequalities in the business sector.  In 1994, blacks owned less than 5% of the country\\'s private enterprises.  As of 2008, there were over 15 black-owned and 29 black-empowered companies listed on the South African stock exchange. The rise in black ownership has been echoed by a significant increase in the black middle class.  Nevertheless, the lack of skilled labor may be hampering the program, as may complicated or unclear regulations.  In 2007, the government instituted the BEE Codes of Good Practice, which make both listed and unlisted companies subject to empowerment requirements and targets, but offer concessions to small businesses and foreign investors.  [49] A new economic growth strategy introduced by the government in November 2010 (see below) proposes a \"major re-think\" and \"substantial revision\" of the BEE codes to increase jobs, skills development, and investment. (RL31697(20))\\n### Foreign Investment\\n In the first decade of post-apartheid rule, analysts expressed concern over the government\\'s ability to attract foreign investment at the levels needed to spur growth.  Sound macroeconomic policies, including reduced tariffs and export subsidies, the loosening of exchange controls, improved enforcement of intellectual property laws, and legislation designed to improve competition have been cited by observers as responsible for the country\\'s economic growth.  A World Bank study finds that South Africa is one of the top 35 easiest countries in which to do business.  [50] Investors are, however, reportedly worried by labor relations, high crime rates, and corruption.  Transparency International ranks South Africa 54 out of 178 in its 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating that it is perceived as less corrupt than other Sub-Saharan African countries (only four African countries ranked less corrupt than South Africa), but more corrupt than many competitors for investment in other parts of the world.  [51] Its ranking has fallen from 43 in 2007.  Political risks arising from potential instability in Zimbabwe are regarded as another deterrent to investors, and South Africa\\'s own racial, class, and political divisions are seen as sources of concern.  Analysts have also highlighted the country\\'s executive \"brain drain\" as one of the greatest threats to South Africa\\'s economic progress. (RL31697(21))',\n",
       "   'summary': 'Over fifteen years after the South African majority gained its independence from white minority rule under apartheid, a system of racial segregation, the Republic of South Africa is firmly established as a regional power. With Africa’s largest Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a diverse economy, and a government that has played an active role in promoting regional peace and stability, South Africa is poised to have a substantial impact on the economic and political future of Africa. The country is also playing an increasingly prominent role in the G20 and other international fora. South Africa is twice the size of Texas and has a population of almost 50 million. Its political system is regarded as stable, but South Africa faces serious long-term challenges arising from poverty, unemployment, and AIDS. \\nThe United States government considers South Africa to be one of its strategic partners on the continent, and the two countries commenced a new Strategic Dialogue in 2010, with the encouragement of the U.S. Congress. Bilateral relations are cordial; however, the U.S. and South African administrations have expressed differences with respect to the situations in Zimbabwe and Iran, among other foreign policy issues. South Africa begins a two-year term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in 2011; U.S. officials articulated frustration with the South African government on positions it took during its last term on the Council in 2007-2008. \\nThe African National Congress (ANC), which led the struggle against apartheid, has dominated the political scene since the end of apartheid and continues to enjoy widespread support among the population. The party has suffered internal divisions, though, some of which contributed to the resignation of President Thabo Mbeki in 2008 and the formation of a breakaway party, the Congress of the People (COPE). The ANC fell short of retaining its two-thirds majority in the parliament during the most recent elections, held in April 2009. Jacob Zuma, elected as head of the ANC in late 2007, weathered a series of corruption charges and was chosen by the ANC-dominated parliament after the 2009 elections to serve as the country’s newest President.\\nSouth Africa has the largest HIV/AIDS population in the world, with almost 6 million people reportedly HIV positive. The Mbeki Administration’s policy on HIV/AIDS was controversial, but the Zuma Administration has made significant commitments to addressing the disease. The country has weathered a series of corruption scandals, and continues to struggle with high crime and unemployment rates. Mounting social tensions related to the competition for jobs, resources, and social services led to an eruption of xenophobic violence against immigrants in 2008; some resentment against foreign workers in the country lingers. South Africa, with its wealth of mineral resources and diverse manufacturing sector, has benefitted from steady economic growth in recent years, but the country weathered a recession in 2009 and economists predict weaker growth prospects for the near future. Job creation remains a major challenge for the government.\\nIn 2010, South Africa successfully hosted the largest event ever held on the African continent, the FIFA World Cup, an international football (soccer) competition. The government and the private sector undertook a wide variety of construction and infrastructure projects in preparation for the event, which was attended by over three million people and drew over 300,000 tourists. South Africa defied many expectations during the event—six new stadiums were finished on time, crime was low, and South Africans introduced the world to a long (and loud) plastic horn known as the vuvuzela. Americans bought more tickets to the event than any other nationality. The games were a point of pride, not only to South Africans, but to many across Africa.',\n",

These patterns varied by sex, race, and ethnicity.  Most of the increase in wage inequality at the bottom of the distribution occurred by 1990 and leveled off by 2000, whereas inequality continued to grow at the top of the distribution after 2000.  Lower wages are associated with less education, and the college wage premium (the ratio of earnings of those with a college degree over those with a high school degree) grew steeply until 2000.  The labor income share of compensation has declined beginning around 2000.  Both the growth in hourly wage inequality and the decline in the labor share of compensation contributed to greater inequality of before-tax income.  From 1979 to 2017, the income share of the bottom quintile fell from 5.3% to 3.5%, whereas the share of the top quintile rose from 41.9% to 50.1%.\\n Several factors potentially contributed to this change in wage inequality: technological advancement, globalization, wage-setting institutional changes (i.e., the minimum wage, presence of labor unions, and decline in the large firm wage premium), immigration, and declines in job mobility, across jobs in general and geographically.\\n A review of the economic research suggests that a major force in causing this growing wage inequality and lower wage growth was skill-based technological change (change increasing the demand for skilled over unskilled workers).  Although there is mixed evidence, most studies find a smaller, modest effect of globalization (although trade affects locations and sectors differently).  The minimum wage appeared to play a relatively small role.  The decline in wages has coincided with the decline in unions, but to some extent, the decline in unions was a consequence of the decline in jobs in heavily unionized sectors due to technological advancement.  Given the size of the decline and the union wage premium, as well as tracing some of the decline to technology, unionization appears to be of limited importance.  The decline in the wage premium for large firms may also be traced to increased competition from technological advancement and globalization.  Evidence also indicates that immigration had little effect on the distribution of wages, but resulted in a slight increase in inequality because immigrants are concentrated at the upper and lower ends of the income distribution.  A decline in labor force mobility has occurred in recent years and could have contributed in some way to inequality.\\n Because the causes of the wage stagnation and growth inequality appear to be traceable largely to technological change, which is otherwise valued, other policies might be considered to increase the well-being of workers whose wages have stagnated.  One policy option is to either increase transfers, including those provided through the tax structure, such as the earned income tax credit.  Childless workers, in particular, have small earned income credits.  Another option is to increase the federal minimum wage, although states are gradually undertaking these increases.  A more far-reaching policy option is a federally guaranteed job.  Proposals have also been made to expand wage insurance, which currently is available to only a narrow group of trade-affected workers. Policies to increase skill acquisition, including a greatly expanded apprenticeship program, could be considered, although they would have delayed effects on inequality.  A variety of policies have been advanced to strengthen unions.  In addition, a number of policies might be considered to increase labor mobility.  Finally, a variety of geographically targeted provisions aimed particularly at increasing employment in chronically high unemployment areas could be considered. Transfers, including the earned income credit, have improved the distribution of after-tax income, but some other policies have a less successful track record, and some (such as a guaranteed job) are untried.\\n \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n \\n\\n The stagnation of real hourly wages at the lower end of the income distribution, where workers tend to be less educated, has entered into the policy debate over many issues, including trade, immigration, and institutional factors such as the minimum wage.  This lack of wage growth has also contributed to an increase in overall income inequality.  The first section reviews changes in the distribution of hourly wages (as well as considering the effects of fringe benefits) and overall income. Following that review, the report reviews the evidence on the main factors that might have contributed to this lack of wage growth, including technological advancement, trade, the minimum wage, unions, the large firm wage premium, immigration, and reduced labor mobility. The final section of the report explores policy options that might be considered by Congress. (R46212(4))',\n",

       "   'text': '## The Economy\\n South Africa\\'s economy is diverse and, until Nigeria revalued its gross domestic product (GDP) measurement methodology in April 2014, was the largest in Africa.  [56] The country is a famed wine producer and exports a range of agricultural products, such as wool, maize, sugar, and fruit and juice, although only about 10% of its land is arable and agriculture contributes less than 3% of the GDP. Industrial contributions to GDP, at 28.4% in 2012, are far more significant.  South Africa is the world\\'s leading producer of platinum and chromium and a major gold, diamond, and coal producer.  Other key industrial sectors include automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, foodstuffs, and iron and steel production.  Services contribute the largest share of GDP, 69%.  [57] South Africa has large and well-developed tourism, banking, energy, legal, communications, and transport sectors.  South African cell phone companies and other firms are active throughout Africa, and SABMiller, formerly South African Breweries, operates globally.  The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is among the 20 largest exchanges globally, and South Africa is one of the few African upper middle income countries (defined by the World Bank as those with a per capita gross national income of \\\\$4,086-\\\\$12,615 in 2012).\\n Domestically, South Africa faces a number of economic challenges.  Low local savings rates mean that South African firms seeking credit must often turn to foreign sources of finance.  Government deficits have increased in recent years, from an average of 0.5% of GDP from 2005 to 2008 to an average of nearly 5% of GDP from 2009 to 2012, and government net debt as a percent of GDP has grown from a low of about 23% in 2008 to over 34% in 2012.  Total external debt stocks have risen steadily, from \\\\$68 billion in 2008 to nearly \\\\$114 billion in 2011. [58] Due to population increases, real per capita GDP growth has also lagged behind national GDP growth rates.\\n An inadequately educated workforce is widely seen as a key hindrance to growth.  Education quality in South Africa ranks poorly in international comparisons, despite large investments in the sector. [59] High unemployment, limited access to social services, and diverse public infrastructure investment needs are also viewed as key barriers to economic growth.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), distortions of demand, supply, and pricing in the labor market, together with other market imbalances, have undermined South Africa\\'s economic production potential and helped \"to preserv\\\\[e\\\\] inequality and high unemployment. \" [60] Despite efforts to increase electricity generation capacity, lack of power is another serious problem.

       "   'summary': 'South Africa is a multi-racial, majority black southern African country of nearly 52 million. It held its first universal suffrage elections in 1994, after a transition from white minority rule under apartheid, a system of state-enforced racial segregation and socioeconomic discrimination. South Africa entered a period of mourning in late 2013, upon the death of its first post-apartheid president, Nelson Mandela. He is viewed as the founding father of the countrys nonracial democratic system, the 20th anniversary of which was recently celebrated prior to national elections on May 7. South Africa is influential regionally, due to its political, trade, and investment ties across Africa and its active role within the African Union. It is viewed as a U.S. strategic partner in Africa, despite periodic foreign policy differences. In mid-2013, President Obama traveled to South Africa, among other African countries. Key issues addressed in South Africa included bilateral political and trade and investment ties, development cooperation, and shared U.S.-South African aims regarding similar issues across Africa, as well as democracy, youth leadership development, and peace and security.\\nCongress has long been engaged with South Africa, notably during the anti-apartheid struggle, and with regard to post-apartheid socioeconomic development efforts, a key focus of bilateral ties. Since 1992, South Africa has been a leading recipient of U.S. foreign aid, mostly devoted to addressing HIV/AIDS and other health challenges. Aid oversight has drawn the bulk of South Africa-related congressional attention in recent years. U.S. policy makers are also increasingly focused on efforts to strengthen already growing U.S.-South African trade and investment ties. Other key areas of bilateral engagement include security cooperation and an ongoing U.S.-South African Strategic Dialogue. Established in 2010, the Dialogue centers on health, education, food security, law enforcement, trade, investment, and energy, among other issues.\\nSouth Africa has the largest, most diversified, and highly industrialized economy in Africa. It has enjoyed moderate economic growth in most recent years. Average per capita incomes and access to education have grown across racial groups, notably for blacks. Despite post-apartheid national socioeconomic gains, South Africa remains a highly unequal society with respect to wealth and income distribution and access to jobs, social services, utilities, and land. Most blacks are poor, and average black incomes are far smaller than those of the historically privileged white minority. Blacks also suffer very high unemployment rates (36% in 2011), and have far less access to education. Shortages of quality housing, utilities, and social services in townshipsthe vast, high-density housing settlements where many of the poor livespur ongoing social and political tensions. Other key problems include public corruption and widespread violent crime. Vigilante justice and mob violence is not uncommon, and heavy-handed police tactics sometimes result in human rights abuses. South Africa also suffers high rates of HIV/AIDS.\\nIn late 2012, the governing African National Congress (ANC) party, despite some reported internal divisions, reelected as its president Jacob Zuma, ahead of the May 2014 national elections. The parliament elected Zuma to his first term as president of South Africa in 2009. The ANC government faces the substantial challenges noted above, along with others, including labor unrest, rising dissatisfaction within key labor constituencies, and dissatisfaction among youths. Youth populations face particularly high jobless rates and may lack older generations continuing allegiance and gratitude to the ANC for helping to end apartheid. To address these diverse challenges, all of which are electoral issues, the government is investing billions of dollars to upgrade infrastructure and improve public service delivery, but is likely to face continuing challenges in meeting popular expectations.',\n",

According to the IMF, the export sector \"generates a significant amount of the wealth\" in the economy and \"facilitates the generation of value added in supporting industries and the provision of services. \" In recent years, two key external developments have posed significant economic challenges.  The 2008-2009 global financial crisis reportedly contributed to a 1.5% decrease in South Africa\\'s real GDP in 2009, although the economy largely recovered, growing to 3.6% by 2011, though it has since slowed.  The second, the European economic crisis, is seen as the reason for a drop in European demand for South African products, although a general rise in exports, most notably to China and Africa, has more than made up for that decline.  South African firms are also expanding their investments in Africa, particularly in banking, mining, and telecommunications.  , below.  provides information on the sectoral composition of the economy and summary trade trends.\\n\\n\\n Table 1.

FDI flows into South Africa have been variable but generally have risen since the early 1990s, peaking at just over \\\\$9 billion in 2008, but dropping moderately in recent years.  In 2012, FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from \\\\$6.04 billion in 2011 to \\\\$4.57 billion in 2012, when FDI stock stood at \\\\$138.96 billion.  In 2012 FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from \\\\$6.04 billion in 2011 to \\\\$4.57 billion in 2012, when FDI stock stood at \\\\$138.96 billion.  However, South African FDI outflows—investments abroad—also increased, from a negative \\\\$257 million in 2011 (compared to the previous year) to \\\\$4.37 billion in 2012, when South African foreign investments totaled \\\\$82.37 billion. [62] The World Bank\\'s annual *Doing Business* survey has found that South Africa is a relatively easy place to do business.  Its ranking under the survey, however, has gradually declined under the Zuma Administration, from 32 \\\\[nd\\\\] in 2009, when President Zuma took office, to 41 \\\\[st\\\\] in 2012, where it remained in 2014.  Key hindrances to FDI growth in recent years have reportedly included violent crime; corruption; Black Economic Empowerment regulation (see below); risks arising from political volatility in neighboring Zimbabwe; and South Africa\\'s own racial, class, and political divisions.\\n A proposed overhaul of South Africa\\'s investment framework, the Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill of 2013, has also raised concerns for some foreign investors.  With respect to FDI, it would replace the use of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with a new investment legal framework applicable to all investors.  In most cases, it would require investment disputes to be resolved by the South African legal system.  For some investors, this may raise questions over matters of alleged expropriation, compensation, national treatment, and rights of establishment, in addition to questions over dispute settlement.  To a large extent, the BIT aspects of the bill would not affect U.S. investors, as no U.S.-South African BIT is in force. [63]\\n In recent years, South Africa has sought an increased role in world economic fora and hosted a number of major global sporting events, such as the 2010 soccer World Cup, and multilateral policy events (e.g., the 2011 U.N. Climate Change Conference and the 2002 U.N. World Summit on Sustainable Development).  It is a member of the G20, and in late 2010, at the invitation of China, joined the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), a political and economic formation of major emerging market economies.  [64] South Africa is a key trading and investment partner of China in Africa, and a key target of increased Chinese economic and diplomatic cooperation over the past decade.

South Africa entered a period of mourning in late 2013, upon the death of its first post-apartheid president, Nelson Mandela. He is viewed as the founding father of the countrys nonracial democratic system, the 20th anniversary of which was recently celebrated prior to national elections on May 7. South Africa is influential regionally, due to its political, trade, and investment ties across Africa and its active role within the African Union. It is viewed as a U.S. strategic partner in Africa, despite periodic foreign policy differences. In mid-2013, President Obama traveled to South Africa, among other African countries. Key issues addressed in South Africa included bilateral political and trade and investment ties, development cooperation, and shared U.S.-South African aims regarding similar issues across Africa, as well as democracy, youth leadership development, and peace and security.\\nCongress has long been engaged with South Africa, notably during the anti-apartheid struggle, and with regard to post-apartheid socioeconomic development efforts, a key focus of bilateral ties. Since 1992, South Africa has been a leading recipient of U.S. foreign aid, mostly devoted to addressing HIV/AIDS and other health challenges. Aid oversight has drawn the bulk of South Africa-related congressional attention in recent years. U.S. policy makers are also increasingly focused on efforts to strengthen already growing U.S.-South African trade and investment ties. Other key areas of bilateral engagement include security cooperation and an ongoing U.S.-South African Strategic Dialogue. Established in 2010, the Dialogue centers on health, education, food security, law enforcement, trade, investment, and energy, among other issues.\\nSouth Africa has the largest, most diversified, and highly industrialized economy in Africa. It has enjoyed moderate economic growth in most recent years. Average per capita incomes and access to education have grown across racial groups, notably for blacks. Despite post-apartheid national socioeconomic gains, South Africa remains a highly unequal society with respect to wealth and income distribution and access to jobs, social services, utilities, and land. Most blacks are poor, and average black incomes are far smaller than those of the historically privileged white minority. Blacks also suffer very high unemployment rates (36% in 2011), and have far less access to education. Shortages of quality housing, utilities, and social services in townshipsthe vast, high-density housing settlements where many of the poor livespur ongoing social and political tensions. Other key problems include public corruption and widespread violent crime. Vigilante justice and mob violence is not uncommon, and heavy-handed police tactics sometimes result in human rights abuses. South Africa also suffers high rates of HIV/AIDS.\\nIn late 2012, the governing African National Congress (ANC) party, despite some reported internal divisions, reelected as its president Jacob Zuma, ahead of the May 2014 national elections. The parliament elected Zuma to his first term as president of South Africa in 2009. The ANC government faces the substantial challenges noted above, along with others, including labor unrest, rising dissatisfaction within key labor constituencies, and dissatisfaction among youths. Youth populations face particularly high jobless rates and may lack older generations continuing allegiance and gratitude to the ANC for helping to end apartheid. To address these diverse challenges, all of which are electoral issues, the government is investing billions of dollars to upgrade infrastructure and improve public service delivery, but is likely to face continuing challenges in meeting popular expectations.',\n",

       " 'formatted_report_grounding': '**R43130:** South Africa: Politics, Economy, and U.S. Relations\\n## The Economy\\n South Africa\\'s economy is diverse and, until Nigeria revalued its gross domestic product (GDP) measurement methodology in April 2014, was the largest in Africa.  The country is a famed wine producer and exports a range of agricultural products, such as wool, maize, sugar, and fruit and juice, although only about 10% of its land is arable and agriculture contributes less than 3% of the GDP. Industrial contributions to GDP, at 28.4% in 2012, are far more significant. South Africa is the world\\'s leading producer of platinum and chromium and a major gold, diamond, and coal producer. Other key industrial sectors include automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, foodstuffs, and iron and steel production. Services contribute the largest share of GDP, 69%.  South Africa has large and well-developed tourism, banking, energy, legal, communications, and transport sectors. South African cell phone companies and other firms are active throughout Africa, and SABMiller, formerly South African Breweries, operates globally. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is among the 20 largest exchanges globally, and South Africa is one of the few African upper middle income countries (defined by the World Bank as those with a per capita gross national income of $4,086-$12,615 in 2012).\\n Domestically, South Africa faces a number of economic challenges. Low local savings rates mean that South African firms seeking credit must often turn to foreign sources of finance. Government deficits have increased in recent years, from an average of 0.5% of GDP from 2005 to 2008 to an average of nearly 5% of GDP from 2009 to 2012, and government net debt as a percent of GDP has grown from a low of about 23% in 2008 to over 34% in 2012. Total external debt stocks have risen steadily, from $68 billion in 2008 to nearly $114 billion in 2011.  Due to population increases, real per capita GDP growth has also lagged behind national GDP growth rates.\\n An inadequately educated workforce is widely seen as a key hindrance to growth. Education quality in South Africa ranks poorly in international comparisons, despite large investments in the sector.  High unemployment, limited access to social services, and diverse public infrastructure investment needs are also viewed as key barriers to economic growth. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), distortions of demand, supply, and pricing in the labor market, together with other market imbalances, have undermined South Africa\\'s economic production potential and helped \"to preserv inequality and high unemployment. \"  Despite efforts to increase electricity generation capacity, lack of power is another serious problem. (R43130(19))\\n-----\\n### South Africa in a Global Economic Context\\n While South Africa\\'s international competitiveness is hindered by the internal structure and dynamics of its economy, global market trends also strongly influence South Africa\\'s internal economic growth patterns. According to the IMF, the export sector \"generates a significant amount of the wealth\" in the economy and \"facilitates the generation of value added in supporting industries and the provision of services. \" In recent years, two key external developments have posed significant economic challenges. The 2008-2009 global financial crisis reportedly contributed to a 1.5% decrease in South Africa\\'s real GDP in 2009, although the economy largely recovered, growing to 3.6% by 2011, though it has since slowed. The second, the European economic crisis, is seen as the reason for a drop in European demand for South African products, although a general rise in exports, most notably to China and Africa, has more than made up for that decline. South African firms are also expanding their investments in Africa, particularly in banking, mining, and telecommunications. , below. provides information on the sectoral composition of the economy and summary trade trends.\\n Table 1.

FDI flows into South Africa have been variable but generally have risen since the early 1990s, peaking at just over $9 billion in 2008, but dropping moderately in recent years. In 2012, FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from $6.04 billion in 2011 to $4.57 billion in 2012, when FDI stock stood at $138.96 billion. In 2012 FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from $6.04 billion in 2011 to $4.57 billion in 2012, when FDI stock stood at $138.96 billion. However, South African FDI outflows—investments abroad—also increased, from a negative $257 million in 2011 (compared to the previous year) to $4.37 billion in 2012, when South African foreign investments totaled $82.37 billion.  The World Bank\\'s annual *Doing Business* survey has found that South Africa is a relatively easy place to do business. Its ranking under the survey, however, has gradually declined under the Zuma Administration, from 32  in 2009, when President Zuma took office, to 41  in 2012, where it remained in 2014. Key hindrances to FDI growth in recent years have reportedly included violent crime; corruption; Black Economic Empowerment regulation (see below); risks arising from political volatility in neighboring Zimbabwe; and South Africa\\'s own racial, class, and political divisions.\\n A proposed overhaul of South Africa\\'s investment framework, the Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill of 2013, has also raised concerns for some foreign investors. With respect to FDI, it would replace the use of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with a new investment legal framework applicable to all investors. In most cases, it would require investment disputes to be resolved by the South African legal system. For some investors, this may raise questions over matters of alleged expropriation, compensation, national treatment, and rights of establishment, in addition to questions over dispute settlement. To a large extent, the BIT aspects of the bill would not affect U.S. investors, as no U.S.-South African BIT is in force. \\n In recent years, South Africa has sought an increased role in world economic fora and hosted a number of major global sporting events, such as the 2010 soccer World Cup, and multilateral policy events (e.g., the 2011 U.N. Climate Change Conference and the 2002 U.N. World Summit on Sustainable Development). It is a member of the G20, and in late 2010, at the invitation of China, joined the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), a political and economic formation of major emerging market economies.  South Africa is a key trading and investment partner of China in Africa, and a key target of increased Chinese economic and diplomatic cooperation over the past decade. China became South Africa\\'s largest trading partner in 2009. (R43130(20))\\n=======\\n**RL31749:** Foreign Direct Investment in China\\n### Summary\\n This report provides an overview of global Foreign Direct Investment in the People\\'s Republic of China, examines its effects on the Chinese economy, surveys U.S. FDI in China, and includes a discussion of policy implications for the United States. China, by far, is the largest recipient of FDI among emerging economies with an inflow of $52.7 billion in 2002 and 424,196 foreign-affiliated firms operating in China representing paid-in foreign investment of $448.0 billion. These firms account for about half of China\\'s exports and imports. Nearly 1,500 U.S. companies from 41 states have direct investments of $10 to $34 billion in China.\\n For the U.S. Congress, foreign direct investment in China entails both oversight and regulatory issues. Some questions with respect to this investment are: (1) the extent to which FDI is contributing to China\\'s economic growth and technology development, (2) the extent to which U.S. FDI in China is contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, (3) whether FDI inflows into China come at the expense of flows into other countries, (4) how FDI is affecting security concerns, and (5) whether FDI affects the export of sensitive technology to China.\\n Foreign direct investment has contributed about 13 % to China\\'s economic growth, and most of China\\'s modern technology, particularly in electronics, has been imported. With respect to trade, there is little doubt that the large surplus in China\\'s trade has been generated largely by the surge in its exports of foreign brand-name manufactures often made in foreign-affiliated factories. As much as 80 to 90% of certain high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firms there. In terms of the U.S. trade deficit with China, American companies there do export some of their output back to the American market, but most is sold in China. China has been attracting some FDI flows that otherwise could have gone to other developing countries. In essence, China\\'s gain may be their loss.\\n In terms of security, the $20 to $34 billion in U.S. FDI in China combined with $68 billion from Taiwan, and some $300 billion from elsewhere is changing the calculus for hostilities and creating groups with a strong interest in stability both within China and between China and the United States, Taiwan, and other potential adversaries. Foreign direct investment in China affects security primarily through three avenues: its contribution to economic power, economic interests, and technology transfers. The more China grows, the more funds it is able to provide to its military and attain big-power status in the world. With respect to economic interests, foreign companies in China can serve both as hostages for Beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue their interests in maintaining stability with both Beijing and their home governments. With respect to sensitive technologies, in the U.S. case, it does not appear that prohibited U.S. technologies have been transferred through foreign affiliated companies, although the technologies in the electronics and aviation industries that have been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses. Such transfers are controlled by export control regimes. The highly publicized cases of satellite technology being allegedly illegally transferred to China involved direct transfers from U.S. corporations to Chinese companies. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant.\\n \\n \\n \\n As the People\\'s Republic of China (PRC) has opened its markets and sought to modernize its economy, it has relied partly on foreign direct investment (FDI) - investments by foreign entities in affiliated companies. ](#n_1_) China, by far, is the largest recipient of FDI among emerging economies with $52.7 billion in FDI flowing into the country in 2002 (according to Chinese data). China, moreover, is expecting FDI inflows to double over the second half of the decade. ](#n_2_) As of December 2002, there were 424,196 foreign-affiliated firms operating in China (34,171 approved in 2002) representing paid-in foreign investment of $448.0 billion out of a contracted amount of $828.1 billion. ](#n_3_) They account for about half of China\\'s exports and imports. U.S. companies have direct investments of $10 to $34 billion in China with nearly 1,500 firms whose headquarters are located in 41 different American states. ](#n_4_)\\n For the U.S. Congress, foreign direct investment in China entails both oversight and regulatory issues. Some questions with respect to this investment are: (1) the extent to which FDI is contributing to China\\'s economic growth and technology development, (2) the extent to which U.S. FDI in China is contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, (3) whether FDI inflows into China come at the expense of flows into other countries, (4) how FDI is affecting security concerns, and (5) whether FDI affects the export of sensitive technology to China.\\n FDI has both direct and indirect effects on China\\'s economic growth. The indirect effects cannot be quantified, but they include demonstration effects (copying of processes, technology, and products by local businesses) and the easing of restrictions in various areas as Beijing gains experience in dealing with foreign businesses. As for direct effects, it has been estimated that foreign investment has contributed about 13% ](#n_5_) to China\\'s economic growth, and most of China\\'s modern technology, particularly in electronics, has been imported.\\n With respect to trade, there is little doubt that the large surplus in China\\'s trade has been generated by the surge in its exports of foreign brand-name manufactures often made in foreign-affiliated factories. As much as 80 to 90% of China\\'s high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firms there. In the early period of liberalization, some foreign factories were allowed in the Chinese market only if they exported their output. In terms of the U.S. trade deficit with China, American companies there do export some of their output back to the American market. Most, however, is sold in China. In 1998, of the $20 billion in total sales by U.S. majority-owned affiliates in China, 14% went to the United States, 69% was sold in China, and 17% went to other markets. ](#n_6_) U.S. merchandise imports from and exports to majority-owned affiliates of American companies in China has been roughly in balance.\\n Other countries, both in Asia and elsewhere, have pointed out that China has been attracting FDI flows that otherwise could have come to their countries. In essence, these economies view China\\'s gain as their loss. Such concerns have been raised in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. ](#n_7_) There is no doubt that China has attracted a rising share of world capital. In 2002, China received over 85% of net direct investment in the Asia/Pacific region ](#n_8_) and has accounted for 20% of total FDI in developing economies. Some investment in China could have been diverted from domestic investment in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. Much of this investment, however, probably would have gone overseas anyway because of competitive pressures and rising labor costs and limited market expansion at home. Countries, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, however, may have lost somewhat in the bidding war to attract foreign investment. The aftermath of the Asian financial crisis and domestic political instability in Indonesia, however, also have played a strong role.\\n In terms of security, the $10 to $34 billion in U.S. FDI in China combined with $68 billion from Taiwan, and some $300 billion from elsewhere is changing the likelihood that hostilities with China will erupt and creating groups with a strong interest in stability both within China and between China and the United States, Taiwan, and other potential adversaries. Foreign direct investment in China affects security primarily through three avenues: its contribution to economic growth, technology transfers, and economic interests. The more China grows, the more funds it is able to provide to its military and attain big-power status in the world. In March 2002, China announced a 17.6% or $3 billion increase in spending, bringing the publicly reported total to $20 billion. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, China\\'s total military spending is closer to $65 billion, and annual spending could increase in real terms over three- to four-fold by 2020. ](#n_9_) FDI, however, contributes only indirectly to this military modernization. With respect to economic interests, foreign companies in China may serve both as hostages for Beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue their interests in maintaining stability with both Beijing and their home governments.\\n With respect to sensitive technologies, in the U.S. case, it does not appear that prohibited U.S. technologies have been transferred through foreign affiliated companies, although the technologies in the electronics and aviation industries that have been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses. Such transfers are controlled by export control regimes. The highly publicized cases of satellite technology being allegedly illegally transferred to China involved direct transfers from U.S. corporations to Chinese companies. ](#n_10_) (RL31749(3))\\n=======\\n**R46212:** Wage Inequality and the Stagnation of Earnings of Low-Wage Workers: Contributing Factors and Policy Options\\n# Wage Inequality and the Stagnation of Earnings of Low-Wage Workers: Contributing Factors and Policy Options\\n February 5, 2020 (R46212) (#Content)\\n  (R46212(1))\\n## Contents\\n  \\n- [Factors Potentially Contributing to Wage and Income- (#_Toc31900134)\\n \\n- [Globalization, International Trade, and Import- (#_Toc31900136)\\n                 ## Tables\\n \\n \\n- [Table 2. Shares of Income Before and After Taxes and Means-Tested## Summary\\n Over the 1979-2018 period, real wages at the 10  percentile of the hourly wage distribution grew by 1.6%, whereas wages at the 50  percentile grew by 6.1% and wages at the 90  percentile grew by 37.6%. These patterns varied by sex, race, and ethnicity. Most of the increase in wage inequality at the bottom of the distribution occurred by 1990 and leveled off by 2000, whereas inequality continued to grow at the top of the distribution after 2000. Lower wages are associated with less education, and the college wage premium (the ratio of earnings of those with a college degree over those with a high school degree) grew steeply until 2000. The labor income share of compensation has declined beginning around 2000. Both the growth in hourly wage inequality and the decline in the labor share of compensation contributed to greater inequality of before-tax income. From 1979 to 2017, the income share of the bottom quintile fell from 5.3% to 3.5%, whereas the share of the top quintile rose from 41.9% to 50.1%.\\n Several factors potentially contributed to this change in wage inequality: technological advancement, globalization, wage-setting institutional changes (i.e., the minimum wage, presence of labor unions, and decline in the large firm wage premium), immigration, and declines in job mobility, across jobs in general and geographically.\\n A review of the economic research suggests that a major force in causing this growing wage inequality and lower wage growth was skill-based technological change (change increasing the demand for skilled over unskilled workers). Although there is mixed evidence, most studies find a smaller, modest effect of globalization (although trade affects locations and sectors differently). The minimum wage appeared to play a relatively small role. The decline in wages has coincided with the decline in unions, but to some extent, the decline in unions was a consequence of the decline in jobs in heavily unionized sectors due to technological advancement. Given the size of the decline and the union wage premium, as well as tracing some of the decline to technology, unionization appears to be of limited importance. The decline in the wage premium for large firms may also be traced to increased competition from technological advancement and globalization. Evidence also indicates that immigration had little effect on the distribution of wages, but resulted in a slight increase in inequality because immigrants are concentrated at the upper and lower ends of the income distribution. A decline in labor force mobility has occurred in recent years and could have contributed in some way to inequality.\\n Because the causes of the wage stagnation and growth inequality appear to be traceable largely to technological change, which is otherwise valued, other policies might be considered to increase the well-being of workers whose wages have stagnated. One policy option is to either increase transfers, including those provided through the tax structure, such as the earned income tax credit. Childless workers, in particular, have small earned income credits. Another option is to increase the federal minimum wage, although states are gradually undertaking these increases. A more far-reaching policy option is a federally guaranteed job. Proposals have also been made to expand wage insurance, which currently is available to only a narrow group of trade-affected workers. Policies to increase skill acquisition, including a greatly expanded apprenticeship program, could be considered, although they would have delayed effects on inequality. A variety of policies have been advanced to strengthen unions. In addition, a number of policies might be considered to increase labor mobility. Finally, a variety of geographically targeted provisions aimed particularly at increasing employment in chronically high unemployment areas could be considered. Transfers, including the earned income credit, have improved the distribution of after-tax income, but some other policies have a less successful track record, and some (such as a guaranteed job) are untried.\\n \\n \\n The stagnation of real hourly wages at the lower end of the income distribution, where workers tend to be less educated, has entered into the policy debate over many issues, including trade, immigration, and institutional factors such as the minimum wage. This lack of wage growth has also contributed to an increase in overall income inequality. The first section reviews changes in the distribution of hourly wages (as well as considering the effects of fringe benefits) and overall income. Following that review, the report reviews the evidence on the main factors that might have contributed to this lack of wage growth, including technological advancement, trade, the minimum wage, unions, the large firm wage premium, immigration, and reduced labor mobility. The final section of the report explores policy options that might be considered by Congress. (R46212(4))\\n=======\\n**RL31697:** South Africa: Current Issues and U.S. Relations\\n## The Economy\\n In 2009, South Africa weathered its first recession in 17 years. The rate of growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged 3% per year in the first decade after apartheid and rose to an average of 5% from 2004 to 2007. The growth rate fell to 3.7% in 2008 and -1.8% in 2009, due in part to the global economic downturn; it rose to an estimated 2.8% in 2010. The growth rate is expected to rise to 3.7% in 2011.  Much higher rates will be needed if South Africa is to substantially increase employment among the black majority and reduce the sharp inequalities in income distribution among the races. Unemployment estimates range from 25% to 40%, far above the government\\'s target of 15%. The vast, poverty-stricken townships surrounding South Africa\\'s cities remain a potential source of political instability. In recent years periodic riots have erupted in several poor municipalities to protest local government corruption and inadequate service delivery. Although turnout and support for the ANC remained high nationally in the country\\'s last nationwide municipal elections, voters boycotted the polls in a number of townships in which the ANC had formerly enjoyed strong support, and several hundred former ANC supporters stood as independent candidates. Conditions in the townships have improved marginally with the expanded availability of electricity and the provision of clean water taps. However, the widening gap between the rich and poor is likely to pose a continuing challenge. (RL31697(18))\\n### Economic Policies Under Thabo Mbeki\\n South Africa won praise from international economists for its reform-oriented macro-economic policy in the late 1990s, which, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, \"demonstrated its commitment to open markets, privatization, and a favorable investment climate, moving away from the former government\\'s strategy of import substitution and industrial development that protected local industries with high tariff barriers. \"  The policy, known as the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, delivered mixed results—it engendered macroeconomic stability, fiscal discipline, and trade liberalization. However, unemployment continued to rise, and income distribution remained highly skewed, largely along racial lines. Nevertheless, the income of the average black household almost doubled in the first decade after the end of apartheid. In late 2007, the government announced that the average national income had risen 22% since 1999. \\n In 2005, the government unveiled a new economic plan, the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA). It was designed to raise the economic growth rate to 4.5% from 2004-2009 and to at least 6% from 2010-1014 through targeted interventions, including public investment in infrastructure, and to cut unemployment rates in half by 2014. These targets, optimistic prior to the economic downturn, are likely now unattainable in the near term.\\n Some economists attribute South Africa\\'s economic difficulties, in part, to the slow pace of privatization. Despite its commitment to privatization, the Mbeki government remained heavily involved in transportation, communications, energy production, and the defense sector, and after the 2004 elections expressed a desire to restructure most remaining state-owned enterprises rather than expand privatization. Further privatization delays were due in part to government concerns that privatization would boost unemployment temporarily, fueling criticism from COSATU and the SACP. According to COSATU and SACP, the job cutbacks that often follow privatization are contributing to the country\\'s unemployment and growing income gap. (RL31697(19))\\n### Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)\\n The government has sought to promote \"black empowerment\" by assuring that a significant portion of the shares in privatized companies would be acquired by black South Africans rather than by wealthy whites or foreign investors. Its Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) program, initiated in 1994, was designed to address racial inequalities in the business sector. In 1994, blacks owned less than 5% of the country\\'s private enterprises. As of 2008, there were over 15 black-owned and 29 black-empowered companies listed on the South African stock exchange. The rise in black ownership has been echoed by a significant increase in the black middle class. Nevertheless, the lack of skilled labor may be hampering the program, as may complicated or unclear regulations. In 2007, the government instituted the BEE Codes of Good Practice, which make both listed and unlisted companies subject to empowerment requirements and targets, but offer concessions to small businesses and foreign investors.  A new economic growth strategy introduced by the government in November 2010 (see below) proposes a \"major re-think\" and \"substantial revision\" of the BEE codes to increase jobs, skills development, and investment. (RL31697(20))\\n### Foreign Investment\\n In the first decade of post-apartheid rule, analysts expressed concern over the government\\'s ability to attract foreign investment at the levels needed to spur growth. Sound macroeconomic policies, including reduced tariffs and export subsidies, the loosening of exchange controls, improved enforcement of intellectual property laws, and legislation designed to improve competition have been cited by observers as responsible for the country\\'s economic growth. A World Bank study finds that South Africa is one of the top 35 easiest countries in which to do business.  Investors are, however, reportedly worried by labor relations, high crime rates, and corruption. Transparency International ranks South Africa 54 out of 178 in its 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating that it is perceived as less corrupt than other Sub-Saharan African countries (only four African countries ranked less corrupt than South Africa), but more corrupt than many competitors for investment in other parts of the world.  Its ranking has fallen from 43 in 2007. Political risks arising from potential instability in Zimbabwe are regarded as another deterrent to investors, and South Africa\\'s own racial, class, and political divisions are seen as sources of concern. Analysts have also highlighted the country\\'s executive \"brain drain\" as one of the greatest threats to South Africa\\'s economic progress. (RL31697(21))',\n",

The country is a famed wine producer and exports a range of agricultural products, such as wool, maize, sugar, and fruit and juice, although only about 10% of its land is arable and agriculture contributes less than 3% of the GDP. Industrial contributions to GDP, at 28.4% in 2012, are far more significant. South Africa is the world\\'s leading producer of platinum and chromium and a major gold, diamond, and coal producer. Other key industrial sectors include automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, foodstuffs, and iron and steel production. Services contribute the largest share of GDP, 69%.  South Africa has large and well-developed tourism, banking, energy, legal, communications, and transport sectors. South African cell phone companies and other firms are active throughout Africa, and SABMiller, formerly South African Breweries, operates globally. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is among the 20 largest exchanges globally, and South Africa is one of the few African upper middle income countries (defined by the World Bank as those with a per capita gross national income of $4,086-$12,615 in 2012).\\n Domestically, South Africa faces a number of economic challenges. Low local savings rates mean that South African firms seeking credit must often turn to foreign sources of finance. Government deficits have increased in recent years, from an average of 0.5% of GDP from 2005 to 2008 to an average of nearly 5% of GDP from 2009 to 2012, and government net debt as a percent of GDP has grown from a low of about 23% in 2008 to over 34% in 2012. Total external debt stocks have risen steadily, from $68 billion in 2008 to nearly $114 billion in 2011.  Due to population increases, real per capita GDP growth has also lagged behind national GDP growth rates.\\n An inadequately educated workforce is widely seen as a key hindrance to growth. Education quality in South Africa ranks poorly in international comparisons, despite large investments in the sector.  High unemployment, limited access to social services, and diverse public infrastructure investment needs are also viewed as key barriers to economic growth. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), distortions of demand, supply, and pricing in the labor market, together with other market imbalances, have undermined South Africa\\'s economic production potential and helped \"to preserv inequality and high unemployment. \"  Despite efforts to increase electricity generation capacity, lack of power is another serious problem. (R43130(19))\\n-----\\n### South Africa in a Global Economic Context\\n While South Africa\\'s international competitiveness is hindered by the internal structure and dynamics of its economy, global market trends also strongly influence South Africa\\'s internal economic growth patterns. According to the IMF, the export sector \"generates a significant amount of the wealth\" in the economy and \"facilitates the generation of value added in supporting industries and the provision of services. \" In recent years, two key external developments have posed significant economic challenges. The 2008-2009 global financial crisis reportedly contributed to a 1.5% decrease in South Africa\\'s real GDP in 2009, although the economy largely recovered, growing to 3.6% by 2011, though it has since slowed. The second, the European economic crisis, is seen as the reason for a drop in European demand for South African products, although a general rise in exports, most notably to China and Africa, has more than made up for that decline. South African firms are also expanding their investments in Africa, particularly in banking, mining, and telecommunications. , below. provides information on the sectoral composition of the economy and summary trade trends.\\n Table 1.

FDI flows into South Africa have been variable but generally have risen since the early 1990s, peaking at just over $9 billion in 2008, but dropping moderately in recent years. In 2012, FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from $6.04 billion in 2011 to $4.57 billion in 2012, when FDI stock stood at $138.96 billion. In 2012 FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from $6.04 billion in 2011 to $4.57 billion in 2012, when FDI stock stood at $138.96 billion. However, South African FDI outflows—investments abroad—also increased, from a negative $257 million in 2011 (compared to the previous year) to $4.37 billion in 2012, when South African foreign investments totaled $82.37 billion.  The World Bank\\'s annual *Doing Business* survey has found that South Africa is a relatively easy place to do business. Its ranking under the survey, however, has gradually declined under the Zuma Administration, from 32  in 2009, when President Zuma took office, to 41  in 2012, where it remained in 2014. Key hindrances to FDI growth in recent years have reportedly included violent crime; corruption; Black Economic Empowerment regulation (see below); risks arising from political volatility in neighboring Zimbabwe; and South Africa\\'s own racial, class, and political divisions.\\n A proposed overhaul of South Africa\\'s investment framework, the Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill of 2013, has also raised concerns for some foreign investors. With respect to FDI, it would replace the use of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with a new investment legal framework applicable to all investors. In most cases, it would require investment disputes to be resolved by the South African legal system. For some investors, this may raise questions over matters of alleged expropriation, compensation, national treatment, and rights of establishment, in addition to questions over dispute settlement. To a large extent, the BIT aspects of the bill would not affect U.S. investors, as no U.S.-South African BIT is in force. \\n In recent years, South Africa has sought an increased role in world economic fora and hosted a number of major global sporting events, such as the 2010 soccer World Cup, and multilateral policy events (e.g., the 2011 U.N. Climate Change Conference and the 2002 U.N. World Summit on Sustainable Development). It is a member of the G20, and in late 2010, at the invitation of China, joined the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), a political and economic formation of major emerging market economies.  South Africa is a key trading and investment partner of China in Africa, and a key target of increased Chinese economic and diplomatic cooperation over the past decade. China became South Africa\\'s largest trading partner in 2009. (R43130(20))\\n=======\\n**RL31749:** Foreign Direct Investment in China\\n### Summary\\n This report provides an overview of global Foreign Direct Investment in the People\\'s Republic of China, examines its effects on the Chinese economy, surveys U.S. FDI in China, and includes a discussion of policy implications for the United States. China, by far, is the largest recipient of FDI among emerging economies with an inflow of $52.7 billion in 2002 and 424,196 foreign-affiliated firms operating in China representing paid-in foreign investment of $448.0 billion. These firms account for about half of China\\'s exports and imports. Nearly 1,500 U.S. companies from 41 states have direct investments of $10 to $34 billion in China.\\n For the U.S. Congress, foreign direct investment in China entails both oversight and regulatory issues. Some questions with respect to this investment are: (1) the extent to which FDI is contributing to China\\'s economic growth and technology development, (2) the extent to which U.S. FDI in China is contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, (3) whether FDI inflows into China come at the expense of flows into other countries, (4) how FDI is affecting security concerns, and (5) whether FDI affects the export of sensitive technology to China.\\n Foreign direct investment has contributed about 13 % to China\\'s economic growth, and most of China\\'s modern technology, particularly in electronics, has been imported. With respect to trade, there is little doubt that the large surplus in China\\'s trade has been generated largely by the surge in its exports of foreign brand-name manufactures often made in foreign-affiliated factories. As much as 80 to 90% of certain high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firms there. In terms of the U.S. trade deficit with China, American companies there do export some of their output back to the American market, but most is sold in China. China has been attracting some FDI flows that otherwise could have gone to other developing countries. In essence, China\\'s gain may be their loss.\\n In terms of security, the $20 to $34 billion in U.S. FDI in China combined with $68 billion from Taiwan, and some $300 billion from elsewhere is changing the calculus for hostilities and creating groups with a strong interest in stability both within China and between China and the United States, Taiwan, and other potential adversaries. Foreign direct investment in China affects security primarily through three avenues: its contribution to economic power, economic interests, and technology transfers. The more China grows, the more funds it is able to provide to its military and attain big-power status in the world. With respect to economic interests, foreign companies in China can serve both as hostages for Beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue their interests in maintaining stability with both Beijing and their home governments. With respect to sensitive technologies, in the U.S. case, it does not appear that prohibited U.S. technologies have been transferred through foreign affiliated companies, although the technologies in the electronics and aviation industries that have been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses. Such transfers are controlled by export control regimes. The highly publicized cases of satellite technology being allegedly illegally transferred to China involved direct transfers from U.S. corporations to Chinese companies. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant.\\n \\n \\n \\n As the People\\'s Republic of China (PRC) has opened its markets and sought to modernize its economy, it has relied partly on foreign direct investment (FDI) - investments by foreign entities in affiliated companies. ](#n_1_) China, by far, is the largest recipient of FDI among emerging economies with $52.7 billion in FDI flowing into the country in 2002 (according to Chinese data). China, moreover, is expecting FDI inflows to double over the second half of the decade. ](#n_2_) As of December 2002, there were 424,196 foreign-affiliated firms operating in China (34,171 approved in 2002) representing paid-in foreign investment of $448.0 billion out of a contracted amount of $828.1 billion. ](#n_3_) They account for about half of China\\'s exports and imports. U.S. companies have direct investments of $10 to $34 billion in China with nearly 1,500 firms whose headquarters are located in 41 different American states. ](#n_4_)\\n For the U.S. Congress, foreign direct investment in China entails both oversight and regulatory issues. Some questions with respect to this investment are: (1) the extent to which FDI is contributing to China\\'s economic growth and technology development, (2) the extent to which U.S. FDI in China is contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, (3) whether FDI inflows into China come at the expense of flows into other countries, (4) how FDI is affecting security concerns, and (5) whether FDI affects the export of sensitive technology to China.\\n FDI has both direct and indirect effects on China\\'s economic growth. The indirect effects cannot be quantified, but they include demonstration effects (copying of processes, technology, and products by local businesses) and the easing of restrictions in various areas as Beijing gains experience in dealing with foreign businesses. As for direct effects, it has been estimated that foreign investment has contributed about 13% ](#n_5_) to China\\'s economic growth, and most of China\\'s modern technology, particularly in electronics, has been imported.\\n With respect to trade, there is little doubt that the large surplus in China\\'s trade has been generated by the surge in its exports of foreign brand-name manufactures often made in foreign-affiliated factories. As much as 80 to 90% of China\\'s high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firms there. In the early period of liberalization, some foreign factories were allowed in the Chinese market only if they exported their output. In terms of the U.S. trade deficit with China, American companies there do export some of their output back to the American market. Most, however, is sold in China. In 1998, of the $20 billion in total sales by U.S. majority-owned affiliates in China, 14% went to the United States, 69% was sold in China, and 17% went to other markets. ](#n_6_) U.S. merchandise imports from and exports to majority-owned affiliates of American companies in China has been roughly in balance.\\n Other countries, both in Asia and elsewhere, have pointed out that China has been attracting FDI flows that otherwise could have come to their countries. In essence, these economies view China\\'s gain as their loss. Such concerns have been raised in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. ](#n_7_) There is no doubt that China has attracted a rising share of world capital. In 2002, China received over 85% of net direct investment in the Asia/Pacific region ](#n_8_) and has accounted for 20% of total FDI in developing economies. Some investment in China could have been diverted from domestic investment in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. Much of this investment, however, probably would have gone overseas anyway because of competitive pressures and rising labor costs and limited market expansion at home. Countries, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, however, may have lost somewhat in the bidding war to attract foreign investment. The aftermath of the Asian financial crisis and domestic political instability in Indonesia, however, also have played a strong role.\\n In terms of security, the $10 to $34 billion in U.S. FDI in China combined with $68 billion from Taiwan, and some $300 billion from elsewhere is changing the likelihood that hostilities with China will erupt and creating groups with a strong interest in stability both within China and between China and the United States, Taiwan, and other potential adversaries. Foreign direct investment in China affects security primarily through three avenues: its contribution to economic growth, technology transfers, and economic interests. The more China grows, the more funds it is able to provide to its military and attain big-power status in the world. In March 2002, China announced a 17.6% or $3 billion increase in spending, bringing the publicly reported total to $20 billion. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, China\\'s total military spending is closer to $65 billion, and annual spending could increase in real terms over three- to four-fold by 2020. ](#n_9_) FDI, however, contributes only indirectly to this military modernization. With respect to economic interests, foreign companies in China may serve both as hostages for Beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue their interests in maintaining stability with both Beijing and their home governments.\\n With respect to sensitive technologies, in the U.S. case, it does not appear that prohibited U.S. technologies have been transferred through foreign affiliated companies, although the technologies in the electronics and aviation industries that have been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses. Such transfers are controlled by export control regimes. The highly publicized cases of satellite technology being allegedly illegally transferred to China involved direct transfers from U.S. corporations to Chinese companies. ](#n_10_) (RL31749(3))\\n=======\\n**R46212:** Wage Inequality and the Stagnation of Earnings of Low-Wage Workers: Contributing Factors and Policy Options\\n# Wage Inequality and the Stagnation of Earnings of Low-Wage Workers: Contributing Factors and Policy Options\\n February 5, 2020 (R46212) (#Content)\\n  (R46212(1))\\n## Contents\\n  \\n- [Factors Potentially Contributing to Wage and Income- (#_Toc31900134)\\n \\n- [Globalization, International Trade, and Import- (#_Toc31900136)\\n                 ## Tables\\n \\n \\n- [Table 2. Shares of Income Before and After Taxes and Means-Tested## Summary\\n Over the 1979-2018 period, real wages at the 10  percentile of the hourly wage distribution grew by 1.6%, whereas wages at the 50  percentile grew by 6.1% and wages at the 90  percentile grew by 37.6%. These patterns varied by sex, race, and ethnicity. Most of the increase in wage inequality at the bottom of the distribution occurred by 1990 and leveled off by 2000, whereas inequality continued to grow at the top of the distribution after 2000. Lower wages are associated with less education, and the college wage premium (the ratio of earnings of those with a college degree over those with a high school degree) grew steeply until 2000. The labor income share of compensation has declined beginning around 2000. Both the growth in hourly wage inequality and the decline in the labor share of compensation contributed to greater inequality of before-tax income. From 1979 to 2017, the income share of the bottom quintile fell from 5.3% to 3.5%, whereas the share of the top quintile rose from 41.9% to 50.1%.\\n Several factors potentially contributed to this change in wage inequality: technological advancement, globalization, wage-setting institutional changes (i.e., the minimum wage, presence of labor unions, and decline in the large firm wage premium), immigration, and declines in job mobility, across jobs in general and geographically.\\n A review of the economic research suggests that a major force in causing this growing wage inequality and lower wage growth was skill-based technological change (change increasing the demand for skilled over unskilled workers). Although there is mixed evidence, most studies find a smaller, modest effect of globalization (although trade affects locations and sectors differently). The minimum wage appeared to play a relatively small role. The decline in wages has coincided with the decline in unions, but to some extent, the decline in unions was a consequence of the decline in jobs in heavily unionized sectors due to technological advancement. Given the size of the decline and the union wage premium, as well as tracing some of the decline to technology, unionization appears to be of limited importance. The decline in the wage premium for large firms may also be traced to increased competition from technological advancement and globalization. Evidence also indicates that immigration had little effect on the distribution of wages, but resulted in a slight increase in inequality because immigrants are concentrated at the upper and lower ends of the income distribution. A decline in labor force mobility has occurred in recent years and could have contributed in some way to inequality.\\n Because the causes of the wage stagnation and growth inequality appear to be traceable largely to technological change, which is otherwise valued, other policies might be considered to increase the well-being of workers whose wages have stagnated. One policy option is to either increase transfers, including those provided through the tax structure, such as the earned income tax credit. Childless workers, in particular, have small earned income credits. Another option is to increase the federal minimum wage, although states are gradually undertaking these increases. A more far-reaching policy option is a federally guaranteed job. Proposals have also been made to expand wage insurance, which currently is available to only a narrow group of trade-affected workers. Policies to increase skill acquisition, including a greatly expanded apprenticeship program, could be considered, although they would have delayed effects on inequality. A variety of policies have been advanced to strengthen unions. In addition, a number of policies might be considered to increase labor mobility. Finally, a variety of geographically targeted provisions aimed particularly at increasing employment in chronically high unemployment areas could be considered. Transfers, including the earned income credit, have improved the distribution of after-tax income, but some other policies have a less successful track record, and some (such as a guaranteed job) are untried.\\n \\n \\n The stagnation of real hourly wages at the lower end of the income distribution, where workers tend to be less educated, has entered into the policy debate over many issues, including trade, immigration, and institutional factors such as the minimum wage. This lack of wage growth has also contributed to an increase in overall income inequality. The first section reviews changes in the distribution of hourly wages (as well as considering the effects of fringe benefits) and overall income. Following that review, the report reviews the evidence on the main factors that might have contributed to this lack of wage growth, including technological advancement, trade, the minimum wage, unions, the large firm wage premium, immigration, and reduced labor mobility. The final section of the report explores policy options that might be considered by Congress. (R46212(4))\\n=======\\n**RL31697:** South Africa: Current Issues and U.S. Relations\\n## The Economy\\n In 2009, South Africa weathered its first recession in 17 years. The rate of growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged 3% per year in the first decade after apartheid and rose to an average of 5% from 2004 to 2007. The growth rate fell to 3.7% in 2008 and -1.8% in 2009, due in part to the global economic downturn; it rose to an estimated 2.8% in 2010. The growth rate is expected to rise to 3.7% in 2011.  Much higher rates will be needed if South Africa is to substantially increase employment among the black majority and reduce the sharp inequalities in income distribution among the races. Unemployment estimates range from 25% to 40%, far above the government\\'s target of 15%. The vast, poverty-stricken townships surrounding South Africa\\'s cities remain a potential source of political instability. In recent years periodic riots have erupted in several poor municipalities to protest local government corruption and inadequate service delivery. Although turnout and support for the ANC remained high nationally in the country\\'s last nationwide municipal elections, voters boycotted the polls in a number of townships in which the ANC had formerly enjoyed strong support, and several hundred former ANC supporters stood as independent candidates. Conditions in the townships have improved marginally with the expanded availability of electricity and the provision of clean water taps. However, the widening gap between the rich and poor is likely to pose a continuing challenge. (RL31697(18))\\n### Economic Policies Under Thabo Mbeki\\n South Africa won praise from international economists for its reform-oriented macro-economic policy in the late 1990s, which, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, \"demonstrated its commitment to open markets, privatization, and a favorable investment climate, moving away from the former government\\'s strategy of import substitution and industrial development that protected local industries with high tariff barriers. \"  The policy, known as the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, delivered mixed results—it engendered macroeconomic stability, fiscal discipline, and trade liberalization. However, unemployment continued to rise, and income distribution remained highly skewed, largely along racial lines. Nevertheless, the income of the average black household almost doubled in the first decade after the end of apartheid. In late 2007, the government announced that the average national income had risen 22% since 1999. \\n In 2005, the government unveiled a new economic plan, the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA). It was designed to raise the economic growth rate to 4.5% from 2004-2009 and to at least 6% from 2010-1014 through targeted interventions, including public investment in infrastructure, and to cut unemployment rates in half by 2014. These targets, optimistic prior to the economic downturn, are likely now unattainable in the near term.\\n Some economists attribute South Africa\\'s economic difficulties, in part, to the slow pace of privatization. Despite its commitment to privatization, the Mbeki government remained heavily involved in transportation, communications, energy production, and the defense sector, and after the 2004 elections expressed a desire to restructure most remaining state-owned enterprises rather than expand privatization. Further privatization delays were due in part to government concerns that privatization would boost unemployment temporarily, fueling criticism from COSATU and the SACP. According to COSATU and SACP, the job cutbacks that often follow privatization are contributing to the country\\'s unemployment and growing income gap. (RL31697(19))\\n### Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)\\n The government has sought to promote \"black empowerment\" by assuring that a significant portion of the shares in privatized companies would be acquired by black South Africans rather than by wealthy whites or foreign investors. Its Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) program, initiated in 1994, was designed to address racial inequalities in the business sector. In 1994, blacks owned less than 5% of the country\\'s private enterprises. As of 2008, there were over 15 black-owned and 29 black-empowered companies listed on the South African stock exchange. The rise in black ownership has been echoed by a significant increase in the black middle class. Nevertheless, the lack of skilled labor may be hampering the program, as may complicated or unclear regulations. In 2007, the government instituted the BEE Codes of Good Practice, which make both listed and unlisted companies subject to empowerment requirements and targets, but offer concessions to small businesses and foreign investors.  A new economic growth strategy introduced by the government in November 2010 (see below) proposes a \"major re-think\" and \"substantial revision\" of the BEE codes to increase jobs, skills development, and investment. (RL31697(20))\\n### Foreign Investment\\n In the first decade of post-apartheid rule, analysts expressed concern over the government\\'s ability to attract foreign investment at the levels needed to spur growth. Sound macroeconomic policies, including reduced tariffs and export subsidies, the loosening of exchange controls, improved enforcement of intellectual property laws, and legislation designed to improve competition have been cited by observers as responsible for the country\\'s economic growth. A World Bank study finds that South Africa is one of the top 35 easiest countries in which to do business.  Investors are, however, reportedly worried by labor relations, high crime rates, and corruption. Transparency International ranks South Africa 54 out of 178 in its 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating that it is perceived as less corrupt than other Sub-Saharan African countries (only four African countries ranked less corrupt than South Africa), but more corrupt than many competitors for investment in other parts of the world.  Its ranking has fallen from 43 in 2007. Political risks arising from potential instability in Zimbabwe are regarded as another deterrent to investors, and South Africa\\'s own racial, class, and political divisions are seen as sources of concern. Analysts have also highlighted the country\\'s executive \"brain drain\" as one of the greatest threats to South Africa\\'s economic progress. (RL31697(21))\\n\\nReport:\\n',\n",
       " 'report': \"## Economic Factors Impacting South Africa\\n\\nThis report analyzes the economic factors impacting South Africa, drawing from provided sources (R43130 and RL31749). It details the structure of the economy, challenges faced, global context, foreign investment trends, and relevant policy initiatives.\\n\\n### I. Overview of the South African Economy \\n\\nSouth Africa possesses a diverse economy that was once the largest in Africa (R43130(19)). Key sectors include:\\n\\n*   **Agriculture:** Contributes less than 3% to GDP despite only 10% of land being arable, exporting products like wine, wool, maize, sugar, and fruit juice (R43130(19)).\\n*   **Industry:** Accounts for 28.4% of GDP (in 2012), with significant production in platinum, chromium, gold, diamonds, coal, automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, foodstuffs, and iron & steel (R43130(19)).\\n*   **Services:** The largest contributor to GDP at 69%, encompassing tourism, banking, energy, legal, communications, and transport sectors. South African firms are active throughout Africa, and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is among the top 20 globally (R43130(19)).\\n*   South Africa is classified as an upper-middle income country by the World Bank, with a per capita gross national income between \\\\$4,086-\\\\$12,615 in 2012 (R43130(19)).\\n\\n### II. Domestic Economic Challenges\\n\\nDespite its strengths, South Africa faces several economic hurdles:\\n\\n*   **Low Savings Rates:** Firms often rely on foreign finance due to low domestic savings (R43130(19)).\\n*   **Government Deficits & Debt:** Government deficits increased from an average of 0.5% of GDP (2005-2008) to nearly 5% (2009-2012), and government net debt rose from approximately 23% to over 34% of GDP during the same period (R43130(19)). Total external debt stocks increased steadily, reaching \\\\$114 billion in 2011 from \\\\$68 billion in 2008 (R43130(19)).\\n*   **Education & Workforce:** An inadequately educated workforce is a key hindrance to growth. Education quality ranks poorly internationally despite significant investment (R43130(19)).\\n*   **Unemployment:** High unemployment rates, estimated between 25% and 40%, remain a major concern (RL31697(18)).\\n*   **Market Distortions:** Distortions in the labor market and other imbalances undermine economic production potential and contribute to inequality and high unemployment (R43130(19)).\\n*   **Lack of Power:** Insufficient electricity generation capacity is a serious problem (R43130(19)).\\n\\n### III. South Africa in a Global Economic Context\\n\\nSouth Africa's economy is significantly influenced by global trends:\\n\\n*   **Exports are Key:** The export sector generates wealth and facilitates value-added industries and services (R43130(20)).\\n*   **Global Financial Crisis Impact:** The 2008-2009 crisis caused a 1.5% GDP decrease in South Africa, though the economy largely recovered with growth reaching 3.6% by 2011 before slowing (R43130(20)).\\n*   **European Economic Crisis:** The European economic crisis reduced demand for South African products, but this was offset by increased exports to China and Africa (R43130(20)).\\n*   **Expanding Investments in Africa:** South African firms are expanding investments in Africa, particularly in banking, mining, and telecommunications (R43130(20)).\\n*   **BRICS Membership:** South Africa joined the BRICS formation (Brazil, Russia, India, China) in 2010, reflecting its role as a major emerging market economy (R43130(20)). China became South Africa's largest trading partner in 2009 (R43130(20)).\\n*   **FDI Trends:** FDI inflows have been variable but generally risen since the early 1990s, peaking at over \\\\$9 billion in 2008. In 2012, FDI inflows decreased by 24%, dropping from \\\\$6.04 billion to \\\\$4.57 billion, while South African FDI outflows increased significantly (R43130(20)).\\n*   **Ease of Doing Business:** South Africa is considered a relatively easy place to do business, though its ranking in the World Bank's *Doing Business* survey has gradually declined since 2009 (R43130(20)).\\n\\n### IV. Policy Initiatives and Economic Strategies\\n\\nSeveral policy initiatives have shaped South Africa’s economic trajectory:\\n\\n*   **Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) Strategy:** Implemented in the late 1990s, aimed for open markets, privatization, and a favorable investment climate; delivered macroeconomic stability but did not substantially reduce unemployment or inequality (RL31697(19)).\\n*   **Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA):** Introduced in 2005, targeted growth of 4.5% (2004-2009) and 6% (2010-2014), with goals to cut unemployment in half by 2014; these targets are now considered unlikely (RL31697(19)).\\n*   **Black Economic Empowerment (BEE):** Initiated in 1994, aims to address racial inequalities in the business sector. The BEE Codes of Good Practice were instituted in 2007, and revisions have been proposed to prioritize job creation, skills development, and investment (R43130(20), RL31697(21)).\\n*   **Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill:** Proposed overhaul of the investment framework requiring dispute resolution through the South African legal system; raises concerns for some foreign investors regarding expropriation and compensation (R43130(20)).\\n\\n### V. Factors Contributing to Wage Inequality & Stagnation \\n\\nResearch suggests several factors contribute to wage inequality and stagnation:\\n\\n*   **Skill-Based Technological Change:** A major force driving wage inequality, increasing demand for skilled workers (R46212(4)).\\n*   **Globalization:** Has a smaller, modest effect on wage inequality (R46212(4)).\\n*   **Minimum Wage:** Appears to have played a relatively small role in wage stagnation (R46212(4)).\\n*   **Decline of Labor Unions:** Coincides with the decline in union wages and job losses in heavily unionized sectors, potentially linked to technological advancement (R46212(4)).\\n*   **Large Firm Wage Premium Decline:** Possibly due to increased competition from technological advancements and globalization (R46212(4)).\\n*   **Immigration:** Has a slight increase in inequality because immigrants are concentrated at the upper and lower ends of the income distribution (R46212(4)).\\n*   **Reduced Labor Force Mobility:** May have contributed to inequality (R46212(4)).\\n\\n### VI. Policy Options for Addressing Wage Stagnation \\n\\nPotential policy options include:\\n\\n*   Increasing transfers, including earned income tax credits (R46212(4)).\\n*   Raising the federal minimum wage (R46212(4)).\\n*   Considering a federally guaranteed job (R46212(4)).\\n*   Expanding wage insurance (R46212(4)).\\n*   Increasing skill acquisition through expanded apprenticeship programs (R46212(4)).\\n*   Strengthening labor unions (R46212(4)).\\n*   Policies to increase labor mobility (R46212(4)).\\n*   Geographically targeted provisions for employment in high unemployment areas (R46212(4)).\\n\\n\\n\\n**Note:** This report synthesizes information exclusively from the provided sources.
