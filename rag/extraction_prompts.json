{"insight_identification": "\nYou are an expert research assistant specializing in public policy analysis. Your primary goal is to analyze a research article and identify potential insights by applying a strict set of rules.\n\n**Part 1: Core Definition of an Insight**\nAn insight is not merely a fact or a finding; it is a conclusion that provides a new level of understanding by answering the crucial question: \"So what?\" A finding reports a result (e.g., \"Participation increased by 30%\"), while an insight explains its significance (e.g., \"The program's success was driven by targeted outreach to a previously overlooked demographic...\").\n\n**Part 2 & 3: Detailed Insight Definitions & Verification Rules**\nAnalyze the document and identify text segments that contain one of the three types of insights defined below. A statement only qualifies as an insight if it passes ALL prongs of the corresponding test.\n\n---\n**1. Novelty/Challenge Insight**\n* **Definition:** This insight changes the conversation. It refutes, refines, or overturns a conventional wisdom or a previously established research finding.\n* **The Disruption Test (Must Pass All):**\n    * **Contradiction Prong:** Does the finding directly refute or significantly challenge a specific, pre-existing assumption?\n    * **Refinement Prong:** Does it introduce a critical new variable or condition that fundamentally alters the established understanding of a policy or effect?\n    * **\"So What?\" Prong:** Would this finding force an informed practitioner or policymaker to reconsider their fundamental approach?\n\n---\n**2. Actionability/Implication Insight**\n* **Definition:** This insight provides a blueprint for action. It translates the research findings into a direct, specific, and justified recommendation for policymakers.\n* **The Blueprint Test (Must Pass All):**\n    * **Prescription Prong:** Does the finding recommend a concrete, specific action or policy change?\n    * **Justification Prong:** Is this recommendation a direct and logical consequence of the evidence presented in the article?\n    * **Implementation Prong:** Does the finding provide guidance on *how* or *where* the action would be most effective, efficient, or impactful?\n\n---\n**3. Causal/Explanatory Insight**\n* **Definition:** This insight reveals the hidden \"why\" or \"how.\" It uncovers the underlying mechanism or process that explains why a policy or social phenomenon produces a certain outcome.\n* **The Mechanism Test (Must Pass All):**\n    * **\"Why\" Prong:** Does the finding explain the underlying process or reason that connects a policy action (Cause A) to an outcome (Effect B)?\n    * **Mechanism Prong:** Does it identify a specific, testable intermediary step or pathway?\n    * **Causal Guardrail Prong:** Does the analysis provide robust evidence for a causal link, not just a simple correlation?\n---\n\n**Instructions:**\n\nBased on the document text and the rigorous rules above, generate a JSON list of objects. Each object represents a single potential insight you have identified. A single insight might reference multiple cited areas (which can be non-contiguous), and a single passage of text might contain multiple insights. It is not necessarily a 1-to-1 relationship.\n\nEach JSON object in the list must contain the following four keys:\n- `insight_type`: (String) Must be one of \"Novelty/Challenge\", \"Actionability/Implication\", or \"Causal/Explanatory\".\n- `insight_name`: (String) A short, descriptive name for the insight that uses accurate language from the research paper.\n- `insight_synopsis`: (String) A brief, 1-2 sentence summary of what the insight is.\n- `related_citations`: (List of Strings) A list of all citations found in or immediately around the insight's text. Citations are alphanumeric strings enclosed in <>, [], or (), and may contain underscores or dashes. An example may be: <ASDF00011_1__9>, or [ASDF00011_1__9], or (ASDF00011_1__9). Citations might also enclose the passage text, for example <ASDF00011_1__9>...passage text...</ASDF00011_1__9>\n\n**Document to Analyze:**\n---\n{document}\n---\n\n**Output:**\n", "insight_template_instructions": "\n# How to Use the Insight Deconstruction Template: A Detailed Guide\n\n### **Overall Purpose**\nThis template is your primary tool for breaking down dense research documents (like academic papers or long reports) into small, manageable, and analyzable pieces. A single report can contain dozens of important claims or \"insights.\" Your job is to capture the details about this insight: \"{insight}\"; so we can evaluate its strengths and weaknesses on its own merits. **Only fill out this template for the desired insight. If there is not enough information\n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: Source and Context**\n*This section is for basic documentation. It is critical for ensuring we can always trace an insight back to its original source.*\n\n* **Original Source Title:** Copy and paste the full title of the article or report.\n* **Author(s) / Organization:** List the names of the individual authors or the name of the publishing organization (e.g., \"RAND Corporation\").\n* **Location in Source:** Be as specific as possible. This is crucial for allowing a senior analyst to quickly find the part of the document you are analyzing. The citation of this is in brackets in this format: [ABCD####__###___###]\n\n! Important: Only use citations that are found in brackets similar to the one I supplied. Do not use references to laws, papers, or other documents. Only use the document's citations when identifying the Location in Source !\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: The Core Insight**\n*This section defines the specific unit of analysis for this report. It is the most important section to get right.*\n\n* **Statement of the Insight:** Your goal is to summarize the core claim in a single, powerful sentence. Think of it as a newspaper headline for the insight. It should be a clear, declarative statement.\n    * *Example:* \"The author claims that state-funded job training programs reduce youth unemployment by an average of 15% within two years.\"\n\n* **Comprehensive Explanation of the Insight:** This is where you provide the necessary nuance, quotes, and description that doesn't fit in the single-sentence statement. In a paragraph, explain the context around the insight. What makes it important? What is the author's angle? Does it challenge a conventional view? What are the specific quotes from the text that are highly relevant.\n    * *Example:* \"X found that Y is significant because it directly contradicts previous studies that found no effect. The argument being that the positive result is due to the inclusion of 'soft skills' training alongside technical skills, a component missing from earlier programs that were evaluated...\"\n\n---\n\n### **Part 3: Deconstruction of the Argument**\n*In this section, you are a neutral reporter. Your job is to objectively extract what the author presented, without yet adding your own critique or analysis. You are simply reporting the facts of their argument.*\n\n* **Evidence FOR this Insight:** This is where you list the building blocks of the author's argument. Be exhaustive and precise.\n\n    * **For each Evidence Point:**\n        * **Description:** Briefly label the type of evidence. Examples: \"Statistical analysis of survey data,\" \"Direct quote from a stakeholder interview,\" \"Case study results from the City X pilot program,\" \"Finding from a literature review.\"\n        * **Key Data/Details:** Be specific. **Do not** write \"the program led to an increase.\" **Do** write \"the program led to a 25% increase in participant wages (from an average of $15/hr to $18.75/hr).\" Use direct quotes or the exact numbers presented by the author.\n        * **Methodology Note:** Briefly explain how this piece of evidence was created. This is crucial for your later analysis of its quality. Examples: \"From a randomized controlled trial with 500 participants,\" \"From an analysis of publicly available census data,\" \"From a series of 25 semi-structured interviews.\"\n        * **Source Note:** This is very important for understanding the foundation of the author's argument. Identify the specific source the author references to support this evidence point. The source text will often contain citations like \"(Smith, 2022)\" or mention \"a report from the RAND Corporation.\" Note that citation here exactly as the author presents it. Example: \"The author cites Smith (2022) for this data point.\"\n\n* **Author's Reasoning FOR this Insight (The \"Why\"):** Explain the author's logic. How do they connect the dots between the evidence points you listed and the main insight? This is where you summarize *their* argument.\n\n* **Evidence AGAINST or Contradicting this Insight:** Did the author present any information that complicates or challenges their own insight? A good researcher often will. Note that here. If the author *didn't* mention any counter-evidence but you know it exists or see a clear gap, you can note that here as well.\n\n* **Author's Reasoning AGAINST this Insight (or for the Nuance):** If the author did present counter-evidence, how did they explain it? Did they dismiss it? Did they say it only applies in certain contexts? This reveals a lot about the author's perspective.\n\n* **Position Taken:** Author's position on the insight in by arguing for the insight, or casting it as a positive insight, or presenting the insight from a neutral position/stance, or arguing against or casting the insight in a negative light. Provide this as a classification: Pro, Neutral, Con.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 4: Analyst's Assessment of This Insight**\n*Now, you shift from a neutral reporter to a critical analyst. This is where you provide your own judgment on the quality and usefulness of this specific insight.*\n\n* **Strength of This Specific Insight:**\n    * **Assessment:** Based on everything you documented in Part 3, make a judgment call. Is the evidence strong and directly supportive? Is the reasoning sound? Or is the evidence weak, anecdotal, or logically flawed?\n    * **Confidence Level:** Summarize your assessment with a simple rating: High, Medium, or Low.\n\n* **Actionable Recommendations or Implications:** This is the \"so what?\" section.\n    * **If this insight is true, it implies that we should:** Think about the practical consequence. What action does this information suggest?\n    * **This insight could be used in our project to:** How does this piece of information fit into our final report? Is it a main point? A supporting detail? A counter-argument we need to address? Be specific.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 5: Connections & Next Steps**\n*This section makes your work discoverable and helps us identify what to do next.*\n\n* **Indexing for Future Reference:** This is crucial for building our knowledge base.\n    * **General Topics:** High-level categories. Examples: \"Environmental Policy,\" \"Education.\"\n    * **Specific Topics:** More focused sub-categories. Examples: \"Carbon Tax Models,\" \"Early Childhood Literacy.\"\n    * **General Keywords:** Broad, searchable terms. Examples: \"climate,\" \"schools,\" \"healthcare.\"\n    * **Specific Keywords:** Precise, technical terms from the insight. Examples: \"cap-and-trade,\" \"phonemic awareness,\" \"vaccine efficacy.\"\n\n* **Unanswered Questions:** What does this insight make you wonder about? What new questions does it raise? Identifying these questions is critical for pointing our research in the right direction.\n\n***Source Document:***\n{document}\n", "insight_extraction_instructions": "\n***Source Document:***\n{document}\n\n-----\n\n# Insight Deconstruction\n\n### **Overall Purpose**\nThis template is for deconstructing research documents into manageable insights.

Core Task & Output**\n\n* **Task:** Using the provided Policy Card and Insight Cards, analyze the policy's long-term resilience and effectiveness under conditions of high uncertainty. This involves identifying key external driving forces, developing a set of plausible future scenarios, and formulating robust strategies that can succeed across multiple potential futures.\n* **Guiding Principle on Limited Information:** This analysis must be based *only* on the provided source materials. If information is insufficient to complete a section, you must explicitly state the limitation in that section and detail the gap in Phase 5. Do not make assumptions or use outside knowledge. The goal is to assess what is knowable from the provided text.\n* **Guiding Principle on Insight Relevance:** Not every provided Insight Card may be relevant to the specific strategic question. Use your judgment to select and apply only the insights that directly inform the identification of drivers, uncertainties, and potential impacts. It is not necessary to use every insight.\n* **Output Requirements:** The final report or presentation must contain:\n    * A clear definition of the policy from the provided Policy Card and the time horizon for the analysis.\n    * An identification of the key drivers of change and critical uncertainties, with full source citation.\n    * A set of 2-4 detailed, plausible, and distinct future scenario narratives.\n    * An analysis of the policy's performance, risks, and opportunities within each scenario.\n    * A set of recommended strategies, distinguishing between robust actions (valuable in all futures) and contingent actions (dependent on a specific future).\n    * A list of \"signposts\" or leading indicators to monitor which future is unfolding.\n    * A \"Follow-Up & Further Research\" section detailing information gaps.\n\n**3. Analytical Workflow & Rules**\n\n#### **Phase 1: Scoping and Identifying Drivers**\n\n* **1.1. Define the Analytical Scope and Time Horizon:**\n    * **Source Policy:** Reference the provided Policy Card.\n    * **Source Insights:** Reference the provided Insight Cards.\n    * **Time Horizon:** Define the time frame for the analysis (e.g., 5, 10, or 20 years). The time horizon should be long enough for significant changes to occur.\n* **1.2. Identify Key Drivers of Change:**\n    * **Rule:** Brainstorm a comprehensive list of external forces by extracting information directly from the provided source materials.\n    * **Guideline for using the Insight Cards:**\n        * Review the \"Comprehensive Explanation,\" \"Evidence FOR this Insight,\" and \"Author's Reasoning\" sections to identify established trends and forces.\n        * Review the \"Actionable Recommendations\" and \"Unanswered Questions\" sections to identify potential future pressures or developments.\n    * **Guideline for using the Policy Card:**\n        * Review the \"Summary\" and \"Arguments Against / Challenges\" sections to identify external pressures, dependencies, and potential obstacles.\n    * **Citation Requirement:** Every key driver, trend, or insight used must be cited in-line. The citation must be the specific alphanumeric location code found in the source materials (e.g., `RL32624_7__1` or `RL32624_111_122`). This ensures full traceability.\n* **1.3. Prioritize Critical Uncertainties:**\n    * **Rule:** From your list of drivers, select the **top two** most critical uncertainties to form the axes of your scenario framework. A driver is a \"critical uncertainty\" if it is both highly important and highly uncertain.\n    * **Guideline for Assessing Importance:** A driver is **important** if it is mentioned across multiple Insight Cards, or if the \"Arguments Against / Challenges\" section of the Policy Card or the \"Actionable Recommendations\" of an Insight Card suggest it has a major impact on the policy's success.\n    * **Guideline for Assessing Uncertainty:** A driver is **uncertain** if:\n        * It is framed as an \"Unanswered Question\" in an Insight Card.\n        * The \"Strength of This Specific Insight\" section indicates a low or medium confidence level.\n        * The Policy Card describes a key feature as \"Unclear\" or notes significant \"disagreements\" among stakeholders.\n        * An Insight Card explicitly identifies a dependency on an external event with an unknown outcome (e.g., \"depend... on outcomes from ongoing... negotiations\").\n\n#### **Phase 2: Scenario Development**\n\n* **2.1. Define Scenario Axes:**\n    * **Rule:** For each of the two Critical Uncertainties selected in Phase 1, define two plausible, extreme outcomes. These will form the axes for your scenarios.\n    * **Format:** List each uncertainty and its two opposing outcomes.\n\n    **Standard Axis Definition Format:**\n\n    * **Axis 1 - [Name of Critical Uncertainty 1]:**\n        * Outcome A: [Description of first extreme outcome]\n        * Outcome B: [Description of second extreme outcome]\n\n    * **Axis 2 - [Name of Critical Uncertainty 2]:**\n        * Outcome X: [Description of first extreme outcome]\n        * Outcome Y: [Description of second extreme outcome]\n\n    * **Guideline:** The four scenarios you develop will be based on the four possible combinations of these outcomes (A+X, B+X, A+Y, B+Y).\n* **2.2. Develop Scenario Narratives:**\n    * **Requirement:** For each of the four combinations, write a detailed and compelling narrative describing that future world. Give each scenario a memorable name that captures its essence.\n    * **Guideline for Grounding Narratives:** To build each narrative, synthesize the \"Comprehensive Explanation\" and \"Evidence\" sections from the Insight Cards. Imagine how those facts and descriptions would change or be emphasized in a world defined by that scenario's specific outcomes. This ensures the scenarios are extensions of the provided evidence.\n\n#### **Phase 3: Impact Analysis and Strategy Formulation**\n\n* **3.1. Stress-Test the Policy:**\n    * **Rule:** For each scenario narrative, analyze the performance of the policy outlined in the provided Policy Card.\n    * **Guideline for Structuring the Stress Test:** For each scenario, explicitly evaluate how the \"Arguments In Favor\" and \"Arguments Against / Challenges\" from the Policy Card would be amplified or diminished. Use the \"Actionable Recommendations or Implications\" from the Insight Cards as a checklist of potential impacts to consider. This directly links the impact analysis to the pre-identified arguments and implications.\n* **3.2. Identify Robust and Contingent Strategies:**\n    * **Requirement:** Based on the stress test, develop a set of strategic options.\n    * **Categorize Strategies:**\n        * **Robust Strategies:** High-priority actions that are beneficial across most or all scenarios.\n        * **Contingent Strategies:** Actions held in reserve, to be implemented only if evidence shows a specific scenario is emerging.\n* **3.3. Define Signposts:**\n    * For each scenario, identify a list of 3-5 \"signposts\" or leading indicators. These are early warning signals that suggest a particular scenario is becoming more likely.\n\n#### **Phase 4: Reporting and Monitoring**\n\n* **4.1. Structure the Strategic Report:**\n    * **Executive Summary:** Briefly describe the four scenarios and highlight the most critical strategic recommendations.\n    * **Introduction:** Define the source policy, time horizon, and the critical uncertainties used to build the scenarios.\n    * **Scenario Narratives:** Present the detailed story for each of the four futures.\n    * **Implications:** For each scenario, discuss the results of the stress test.\n    * **Strategic Options:** Detail the recommended robust and contingent strategies.\n    * **Monitoring Plan:** List the signposts to be tracked.\n\n#### **Phase 5: Follow-Up and Further Research**\n\n* **5.1. Document Information Gaps:**\n    * **Rule:** Explicitly list any areas where the analysis was limited due to missing information in the source documents. You must state what could not be completed and why.\n    * **Example:** \"The economic impact of Scenario 2 could not be fully assessed because the Policy Card lacks specific data on potential funding mechanisms (`RL32624_111_122`).\"\n* **5.2. Formulate Key Questions for Follow-Up:**\n    * **Rule:** Transform each documented information gap into a specific, actionable research question. This formalizes the \"Unanswered Questions\" identified in the source materials.\n    * **Example:** \"What are the three most likely funding mechanisms for 'Green Payments', and what is the estimated cost of each?\"\n* **5.3. Recommend Next Steps:**\n    * **Rule:** For each key question, recommend a concrete next step to obtain the missing information.\n    * **Example:** \"Recommend a targeted review of budget proposals from the last 5 years to identify precedents for funding similar environmental programs.\"\n"}
