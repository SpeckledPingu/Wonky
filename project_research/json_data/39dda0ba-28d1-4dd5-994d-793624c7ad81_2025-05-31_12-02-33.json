        "text": "## Background: Broadband and Rural America\\n The broadband loan and grant programs at RUS are intended to accelerate the deployment of broadband services in rural America.  \"Broadband\" refers to high-speed internet access and advanced telecommunications services for private homes, commercial establishments, schools, and public institutions.  Currently in the United States, residential broadband is primarily provided via cable modem (from the local provider of cable television service), fiber-optic cable, mobile wireless (e.g., smartphones), or over the copper telephone line (digital subscriber line or \"DSL\").  Other broadband technologies include fixed wireless and satellite.\\n Broadband access enables a number of beneficial applications to individual users and to communities.  These include ecommerce, telecommuting, voice service (voice over the internet protocol or \"VOIP\"), distance learning, telemedicine, public safety, and others.  It is becoming generally accepted that broadband access in a community can play an important role in economic development.\\n Access to affordable broadband is viewed as particularly important for the economic development of rural areas because it enables individuals and businesses to participate fully in the online economy regardless of geographical location.  For example, aside from enabling existing businesses to remain in their rural locations, broadband access could attract new business enterprises drawn by lower costs and a more desirable lifestyle.  Essentially, broadband potentially allows businesses and individuals in rural America to live locally while competing globally in an online environment.  A 2016 study from the Hudson Institute found that rural broadband providers directly and indirectly added \\\\$24.1 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015.  The rural broadband industry supported 69,595 jobs in 2015, both through its own employment and the employment that its purchases of goods and services generated.  [1]\\n Given the large potential impact broadband may have on the economic development of rural America, concern has been raised over a \"digital divide\" between rural and urban or suburban areas with respect to broadband deployment.  While there are many examples of rural communities with state-of-the-art telecommunications facilities, [2] recent surveys and studies have indicated that, in general, rural areas tend to lag behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment.  For example\\n \\n- According to the Federal Communications Commission\\\"s (FCC\\\"s)\\n   *Communications Marketplace Report*, \"As of year-end 2017, 94% of the overall population had coverage \\\\[of fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps\\\\], up from 91.9% in 2016.  Nonetheless, the gap in rural and Tribal America remains notable: 24% of Americans in rural areas and 32% of Americans in Tribal lands lack coverage from fixed terrestrial 25 Mbps/3 Mbps broadband, as compared to only 1.5% of Americans in urban areas.  The data demonstrate, however, that the gap between urban and rural or Tribal areas has narrowed each year over the last five years. \" [3] \\n- Also according to the FCC\\\"s *Communications Market Report*, rural\\n   areas continue to lag behind urban areas in mobile broadband deployment.  Although evaluated urban areas saw an increase of 10 Mbps/3 Mbps mobile LTE from 81.9% in 2014 to 92.6% in 2017, such deployment in evaluated rural areas remained relatively flat at about 70%.  [4] \\n- According to January 2018 survey data from the Pew Research Center,\\n   58% of adults in rural areas said they have a high-speed broadband connection at home, as opposed to 67% of adults in urban areas and 70% of adults in suburban areas.  [5] \\n- A November 2017 Census Bureau survey reported by the National\\n   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Digital Nation Data Explorer showed 72.9% of rural residents reporting using the internet, versus 78.5% of urban residents. [6] According to NTIA, the data \"indicates a fairly constant 6-9 percentage point gap between rural and urban communities\\\" internet use over time. \" [7]\\n The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas.  Particularly for wireline broadband technologies\u2014such as cable modem, fiber, and DSL\u2014the greater the geographical distances among customers, the larger the cost to serve those customers.  Thus, there is often less incentive for companies to invest in broadband in rural areas than, for example, in an urban area where there is more demand (more customers with perhaps higher incomes) and less cost to wire the market area.\\n The terrain of rural areas can also be a hindrance, in that it is more expensive to deploy broadband technologies in a mountainous or heavily forested area.  An additional added cost factor for remote areas can be the expense of \"backhaul\" (e.g., the \"middle mile\"), which refers to the installation of a dedicated line that transmits a signal to and from an internet backbone, which is typically located in or near an urban area.\\n Another important broadband availability issue is the extent to which there are multiple broadband providers offering competition and consumer choice.  Typically, multiple providers are more prevalent in urban than in rural areas.  [8] `\\[RL33816__6___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Rural Broadband Programs at the Rural Utilities Service\\n Because private providers are unlikely to earn enough revenue to cover the costs of deploying and operating broadband networks in many unserved rural areas, it is unlikely that private investment alone will bring service to these areas.  [9] In 2000, given the lagging deployment of broadband in rural areas, Congress and the Administration acted to initiate pilot broadband loan and grant programs within the Rural Utilities Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  While RUS had long maintained telecommunications loan and grant programs (Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, Rural Telephone Bank, and more recently, the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Loans and Grants), none were exclusively dedicated to financing rural broadband deployment.  Title III of the FY2001 agriculture appropriations bill ([P.L. 106-387](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d106:FLD002:@1(106+387))) directed USDA/RUS to conduct a \"pilot program to finance broadband transmission and local dial-up Internet service in areas that meet the definition of \\\"rural area\\\" used for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program. \"\\n Subsequently, on December 5, 2000, RUS announced the availability of \\\\$100 million in loan funding through a one-year pilot program \"to finance the construction and installation of broadband telecommunications services in rural America. \" [10] The broadband pilot loan program was authorized under the authority of the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program (7 U.S.C. 950aaa), and was available to \"legally organized entities\" not located within the boundaries of a city or town having a population in excess of 20,000.\\n The FY2002 agriculture appropriations bill ([P.L. 107-76](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d107:FLD002:@1(107+76))) designated a loan level of \\\\$80 million for broadband loans, and on January 23, 2002, RUS announced that the pilot program would be extended into FY2002, with \\\\$80 million in loans made available to fund many of the applications that did not receive funding during the previous year. [11]\\n Meanwhile, the FY2002 agriculture appropriations bill ([P.L. 107-76](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d107:FLD002:@1(107+76))) allocated \\\\$20 million for a pilot broadband grant program, also authorized under the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program.  On July 8, 2002, RUS announced the availability of \\\\$20 million for a pilot grant program for the provision of broadband service in rural America. The program was specifically targeted to economically challenged rural communities with no existing broadband service.  Grants were made available to entities providing \"community-oriented connectivity,\" which the RUS defined as those entities \"who will connect the critical community facilities including the local schools, libraries, hospitals, police, fire and rescue services and who will operate a community center that provides free and open access to residents. \" [12]\\n The pilot program was extended into FY2003, as the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003 ([P.L. 108-7](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d108:FLD002:@1(108+7))) allocated \\\\$10 million for broadband grants.\\n Currently, RUS has four ongoing programs that have been established to incentivize and subsidize broadband infrastructure investment in unserved and underserved rural areas.  These include the following:\\n \\n- *Rural Broadband Access Loans*\u2014funds the costs of construction,\\n   improvement, or acquisition of facilities and equipment needed to provide service in eligible rural areas. \\n- *Community Connect Grants*\u2014funds broadband deployment into rural\\n   communities where it is not yet economically viable for private sector providers to deliver service. \\n- *Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans* *and Loan Guarantees*\u2014funds\\n   the construction, maintenance, improvement, and expansion of telephone service and broadband in extremely rural areas with a population of 5,000 or less. \\n- *Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants*\u2014principally funds end-user\\n   equipment to help rural communities use telecommunications to link teachers and medical service providers in one area to students and patients in another.\\n In addition, a new broadband loan and grant pilot program\u2014the ReConnect Program\u2014has been established and funded at \\\\$600 million by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ([P.L. 115-141](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+141))).\\n  in the Appendix shows the total amount and number of awards provided by the RUS broadband programs for each state between FY2009 and FY2016.\\n In its April 2017 report, *Rural Broadband Deployment: Improved Consistency with Leading Practices Could Enhance Management of Loan and Grant Programs*, GAO reported that (according to RUS data) since FY2004, RUS has approved 704 broadband projects totaling almost \\\\$8.6 billion in loans and \\\\$144.8 million in grants to deploy telecommunications or broadband infrastructure networks in rural areas.

[14] Section 6103 made available, from the funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), a total of \\\\$100 million through FY2007.  [P.L. 107-171](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d107:FLD002:@1(107+171)) also authorized any other funds appropriated for the broadband loan program.

In the FY2004, FY2005, and FY2006 appropriations bills, mandatory funding from the CCC was canceled.\\n The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program is codified as 7 U.S.C. 950bb.  On July 30, 2015, the RUS published in the *Federal Register* the interim rule (7 C.F.R. part 1738) implementing the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program as reauthorized by the enactment of the Agricultural Act of 2014 ([P.L. 113-79](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d113:FLD002:@1(113+79))), [15] and the interim rule was made final on June 9, 2016.  Entities eligible to receive loans include corporations, limited liability companies, cooperative or mutual organizations, Indian tribes or tribal organizations, and state or local governments.  Eligible areas for funding must be completely contained within a rural area (or composed of multiple rural areas).  Additionally, at least 15% of the households in the proposed funded service areas must be unserved, no part of the proposed service area can have three or more incumbent service providers, and no part of the proposed service area can overlap with the service area of current RUS borrowers or of grantees that were funded by RUS.\\n The latest Notice of Solicitation of Applications (NOSA) announced that RUS is now accepting applications on a rolling basis through September 30, 2019, which will give RUS the ability to request additional information and modifications to submitted applications if necessary. RUS will evaluate the submitted applications every 90 days, and anticipates at least two evaluation periods for FY2019.  The minimum loan amount is \\\\$100,000, while the maximum loan amount is \\\\$25 million.  The NOSA has maintained its definition of broadband service and broadband lending speed at no less than 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload for both mobile and fixed services.

The first recommendation of the Task Force\\\"s report to the President was to expand e-connectivity in rural and tribal areas.  [22]\\n To help implement this recommendation, the Administration requested \\\\$500 million in a discretionary add-on to the FY2018 appropriation which would fund a combination grant/loan program at USDA/RUS to deploy broadband in rural and tribal areas.\\n Section 779 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ([P.L. 115-141](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+141))) appropriated \\\\$600 million to RUS to \"conduct a new broadband loan and grant pilot program. \" The law states that the funding is to \"remain available until expended,\" and that\\n \\n- at least 90% of the households to be served by a project receiving a\\n   loan or grant under the pilot program shall be in a rural area without sufficient access to broadband, defined for this pilot program as 10 Mbps downstream, and 1 Mbps upstream, which shall be reevaluated and redetermined, as necessary, on an annual basis by the Secretary of Agriculture; \\n- an entity to which a loan or grant is made under the pilot program\\n   shall not use the loan or grant to overbuild or duplicate broadband expansion efforts made by any entity that has received a broadband loan from RUS; \\n- in addition to other available funds, not more than 4% of the funds\\n   can be used for administrative costs to carry out the pilot program and up to 3% may be utilized for technical assistance and predevelopment planning activities to support the most rural communities; and \\n- RUS shall adhere to the notice, reporting, and service area assessment\\n   requirements previously established in the 2014 farm bill.\\n The Explanatory Statement that accompanied the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act states\\n The agreement reiterates that funding should be prioritized to areas currently lacking access to broadband service, and investments in broadband shall consider any technology that best serves the goals of broadband expansion.  Lastly, the agreement restates the importance of coordination among federal agencies in expanding broadband deployment and adoption and expects the Department to take caution to maximize these limited resources and not overbuild or duplicate existing broadband capable infrastructure.\\n The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ([P.L. 116-6](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d116:FLD002:@1(116+6))) provides \\\\$550 million in FY2019 for the pilot broadband loan and grant program, now called the Rural eConnectivity Pilot Program, or ReConnect Rural Broadband Program.  The \\\\$550 million includes \\\\$125 million in direct appropriation, plus \\\\$425 million to be reprogrammed from the cushion of credit subaccount (7 U.S.C. 940c).  Division B, Section 779 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure that applicants determined to be ineligible for the ReConnect Program have a means of appealing or otherwise challenging that determination in a timely fashion.  The law also directs the Secretary, in determining whether an entity may overbuild or duplicate broadband expansion efforts made by an entity that has received an RUS broadband loan, to not consider loans that were rescinded or defaulted on, or loans the terms and conditions of which were not met, if the entity under consideration has not previously defaulted on, or failed to meet the terms and conditions of, a Rural Utilities Service loan or had a Rural Utilities Service loan rescinded.\\n On December 14, 2018, RUS released the *Funding Opportunity Announcement* (*FOA*) and solicitation of applications for the ReConnect Program.  [23] As set forth in the statute, at least 90% of the households to be served by a project receiving a loan or grant under the pilot program shall be in a rural area without sufficient access to broadband at a minimum speed of 10 Mbps/1 Mbps.  RUS defines \"sufficient access to broadband\" as any rural area that has fixed, terrestrial broadband service delivering at least 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream.  Mobile and satellite service will not be considered in making the determination that households in the proposed funded service area do not have sufficient access to broadband.\\n With the government shutdown delaying the rollout of the ReConnect Program, on February 25, 2019, RUS released an amendment and clarification to the December *FOA*, with revised application deadlines. [24]\\n Approximately \\\\$600 million has been set aside for funding opportunities under the FOA, with additional budget authority available for a reserve which may be used for additional loans or grants.  Award recipients must complete projects within five years.  Entities eligible for awards are states or local governments, U.S. territories, an Indian tribe, nonprofit entities, for-profit corporations, limited liability companies, and cooperative or mutual organizations.  This includes telecommunications companies, rural electric cooperatives and utilities, internet service providers, and municipalities.\\n Funds will be awarded for projects that have financially sustainable business models that will bring broadband to rural homes, businesses, farms, ranches, and community facilities such as first responders, health care facilities, and schools.  The ReConnect Program consists of three funding categories. `\\[RL33816__12___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Impact of Universal Service Reform on RUS Broadband Loan Programs\\n RUS has three programs that provide or have provided loans for broadband infrastructure projects: the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee program (also known as the Farm Bill broadband loan program), the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP under the ARRA), and the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program (established in 1949 as the Rural Telephone Loan and Loan Guarantee program). [25]\\n Whereas RUS broadband loans are used as up-front capital to invest in broadband infrastructure, the Federal Communications Commission\\\"s (FCC\\\"s) Universal Service Fund (USF)\u2014specifically, the high cost fund\u2014has functioned as an ongoing subsidy to keep the operation of telecommunications networks in high cost areas profitable for providers. Many RUS telecommunications and broadband borrowers (loan recipients) receive high cost USF subsidies.  In many cases, the subsidy received from USF helps provide the revenue necessary to keep the loan viable. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program is highly dependent on high cost USF revenues, with 99% (476 out of 480 borrowers) receiving interstate high cost USF support.  This is not surprising, given that the RUS Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans are available only to the most rural and high cost areas (towns with populations less than 5,000). Regarding broadband loans, 60% of BIP (stimulus) borrowers draw from state or interstate USF support mechanisms, while 10% of Farm Bill (Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program) broadband borrowers receive interstate high cost USF support. [26]\\n The FCC, in an October 2011 decision, adopted an order that calls for the USF to be transformed, in stages, over a multiyear period\u2014from a mechanism to support voice telephone service to one that supports the deployment, adoption, and use of both fixed and mobile broadband.  More specifically, the high cost program is being phased out and a new fund, the Connect America Fund (CAF), which includes the targeted Mobility Fund and new Remote Areas Fund, is replacing it. [27]\\n During this transition, the uncertainty surrounding the FCC\\\"s proposed methodology for distributing Connect America Fund monies has led many small rural providers to postpone or cancel investment in broadband network upgrades.  [28] According to RUS, \"demand for RUS loans dropped to roughly 37% of the total amount of loan funds appropriated by Congress in FY2012,\" and \"\\\\[c\\\\]urrent and prospective RUS borrowers have communicated their hesitation to increase their outstanding debt and move forward with planned construction due to the recently implemented reductions in USF support and Inter-Carrier Compensation (ICC) payments. \" [29] `\\[RL33816__16___1\\]`"

The bill included language requiring at least 15% of the account resources (\\\\$18.4 million) be allocated to each program area.  The committee noted that tribal communities continue to struggle with gaining access to broadband service, and encouraged the Secretary to provide a report that identifies the specific challenges Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) have in gaining access to broadband service and provide a plan for addressing these challenges, including how the Community Connect program can assist ITOs.\\n Regarding telecommunications loans, the House matched the Administration proposal, providing a loan level of \\\\$690 million (\\\\$345 million in direct Treasury loans and \\\\$345 million in FFB loans) with an appropriation of \\\\$0.863 million to subsidize direct Treasury loans.\\n Additionally, the House Appropriations Committee report directed USDA to continue coordinating with the FCC, NTIA, and other related federal agencies to ensure that policies tied to one federal program do not undermine the objectives and functionality of another.  The committee directed the department to prepare a report, in collaboration with the FCC and DOC, detailing areas of responsibility toward addressing rural broadband issues.  The report shall include, but not be limited to, how the programs work complimentarily to one another; how they address broadband issues in unserved and underserved areas, including tribal lands; identify barriers to infrastructure investment in rural areas and tribal lands; data speeds which fixed, wireless, and mobile broadband users in rural areas and tribal lands experience; and cost estimates to increase speeds to 25 Mbps in unserved communities and communities currently being served by speeds less than 25 Mbps.\\n On July 20, 2017, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version of the FY2018 agriculture appropriations bill ([S. 1603](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/z?d115:S.1603:); [S.Rept. 115-131](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/cpquery/R? cp115:FLD010:@1(sr131):)). The bill provided \\\\$4.53 million to subsidize a loan level of \\\\$27.043 million for the broadband loan program, \\\\$30 million for the Community Connect grant program, and \\\\$26.6 million for DLT grants.  Unlike the House and the Administration request, the committee did not include funding for Rural Economic Infrastructure grants.  For telecommunications loans, the Senate matched the House bill and the Administration proposal, providing a loan level of \\\\$690 million (\\\\$345 million in direct Treasury loans and \\\\$345 million in FFB loans) with an appropriation of \\\\$0.863 million to subsidize direct Treasury loans.\\n Regarding the broadband loan program, the committee encouraged RUS to focus expenditures on projects that bring broadband service to currently unserved households, and directed RUS to report back to the committee on administrative efforts to eliminate duplicative or overbuilding of broadband technology.

The loan application process has been criticized as being overly complex and burdensome, requiring applicants to spend months preparing costly market research and engineering assessments.  Many applications are rejected because the applicant\\\"s business plan is deemed insufficient to support a commercially viable business.  The biggest reason for applications being returned has been insufficient credit support, whereby applicants do not have sufficient cash-on-hand (one year\\\"s worth is required in most cases).  The requirement for cash-on-hand is viewed as particularly onerous for small start-up companies, many of whom lack sufficient capital to qualify for the loan.  Such companies, critics assert, may be those entities most in need of financial assistance.\\n In report language to the FY2006 Department of Agriculture Appropriations Act ([P.L. 109-97](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d109:FLD002:@1(109+97))), the Senate Appropriations Committee ([S.Rept. 109-92](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/cpquery/R? cp109:FLD010:@1(sr92):)) directed the RUS \"to reduce the burdensome application process and make the program requirements more reasonable, particularly in regard to cash-on-hand requirements. \" The committee also directed USDA to hire more full-time employees to remedy delays in application processing times.\\n At a May 17, 2006, hearing held by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, the Administrator of the RUS stated that RUS is working to make the program more user friendly, while at the same time protecting taxpayer investment:\\n As good stewards of the taxpayers\\\" money, we must make loans that are likely to be repaid.  One of the challenges in determining whether a proposed project has a reasonable chance of success is validating the market analysis of the proposed service territory and ensuring that sufficient resources are available to cover operating expenses throughout the construction period until such a time that cash flow from operations become sufficient.  The loan application process that we have developed ensures that the applicant addresses these areas and that appropriate resources are available for maintaining a viable operation. [42]\\n According to RUS, the loan program was initially overwhelmed by applications (particularly during a two-week period in August 2003), and as the program matured, application review times have dropped. [43] On May 11, 2007, RUS released a Proposed Rule which sought to revise regulations for the broadband loan program.  In the background material accompanying the Proposed Rule, RUS stated that the average application processing time in 2006 was almost half of what it was in 2003.  [44] `\\[RL33816__22___1\\]`"

An audit report released by USDA\\\"s Office of Inspector General (IG) found that the \"programs\\\" focus has shifted away from those rural communities that would not, without Government assistance, have access to broadband technologies. \" [45] Specifically the IG report found that the RUS definition of rural area has been \"too broad to distinguish usefully between suburban and rural communities,\" [46] with the result that, as of March 10, 2005, \\\\$103.4 million in loans and grants (nearly 12% of total funding awarded) had been awarded to 64 communities located near large cities.

For example, the limitation of assistance only to communities of 20,000 or less in population excludes small rural towns that may exceed this limit, and also excludes many municipalities seeking to deploy their own networks. [48] Similarly, per capita income requirements can preclude higher income communities with higher costs of living (e.g., rural Alaska), and the limitation of grant programs only to underserved areas excludes rural communities with existing but very limited broadband access.

    "text": "**USDA\u2019s ReConnect Program: Expanding Rural** December 14, 2022 **Broadband** **Lisa S. Benson** In 2018, Congress provided the Secretary of Agriculture authority to establish a new broadband Analyst in Agricultural loan and grant pilot program (the ReConnect Program) to help close the digital divide and expand Policy broadband deployment in rural areas.  The Federal Communications Commission found in 2019 that approximately 14.5 million Americans lack access to broadband, and more than 11 million of them live in rural areas.  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights this gap between those with access to broadband and those without access, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d For-profit internet service providers supply the majority of broadband access in the United States.  These providers typically build the infrastructure needed to deploy broadband to premises within their service areas.  Internet service providers charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.  Providers tend to deploy broadband to areas where they can reach a high number of people at the lowest cost.  Thus, they tend to avoid deploying broadband to areas with high infrastructure costs and small populations, such as rural areas.  Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141).  The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in eligible rural service areas.  Under the current round of funding, *eligible service areas* are defined as areas where 90% or more of households lack broadband access at speeds of at least 100 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload (i.e., 100/20 Mbps).  ReConnect projects are to provide broadband access to all premises within their service areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps.  Congress has provided funding for the ReConnect Program through annual appropriations acts; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136); and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58).  Congress appropriated \\$600 million for the program in FY2018, \\$550 million in FY2019, \\$655 million in FY2020, and \\$635 million in FY2021 through appropriations acts.  Congress appropriated approximately \\$2.363 billion for the ReConnect Program in FY2022.  Congress appropriated \\$1.926 billion through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58, Division J, Title I) and \\$436.605 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103).  As of December 2022, RUS has awarded \\$3.127 billion in ReConnect Program funding for 282 projects in 43 states and U.S. territories through three rounds of funding.  Congress and some stakeholders have identified issues related to the ReConnect Program, including funding levels, extent of service to rural areas, and the potential for duplication of broadband networks.  In addition to P.L. 117-58, seven other bills introduced in the 117th Congress would affect the ReConnect Program.  The bills would combine the ReConnect Program and Rural Broadband Program (H.R. 4374, H.R. 3369), add safeguards to avoid duplication across ReConnect projects and other federally funded broadband projects (H.R. 3435, H.R. 4825, S. 944), and expand the allowable activities that could be funded through the ReConnect Program (H.R. 2400, H.R. 3654).  Additional policy options Congress could consider regarding the ReConnect Program might include addressing broadband affordability in rural areas and training and education to increase broadband adoption among rural residents.

    "sections": "{'1': '**USDA\u2019s ReConnect Program: Expanding Rural** December 14, 2022 **Broadband** **Lisa S. Benson** In 2018, Congress provided the Secretary of Agriculture authority to establish a new broadband Analyst in Agricultural loan and grant pilot program (the ReConnect Program) to help close the digital divide and expand Policy broadband deployment in rural areas.  The Federal Communications Commission found in 2019 that approximately 14.5 million Americans lack access to broadband, and more than 11 million of them live in rural areas.  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights this gap between those with access to broadband and those without access, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d For-profit internet service providers supply the majority of broadband access in the United States.  These providers typically build the infrastructure needed to deploy broadband to premises within their service areas.  Internet service providers charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.  Providers tend to deploy broadband to areas where they can reach a high number of people at the lowest cost.  Thus, they tend to avoid deploying broadband to areas with high infrastructure costs and small populations, such as rural areas.  Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141).  The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in eligible rural service areas.  Under the current round of funding, *eligible service areas* are defined as areas where 90% or more of households lack broadband access at speeds of at least 100 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload (i.e., 100/20 Mbps).  ReConnect projects are to provide broadband access to all premises within their service areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps.  Congress has provided funding for the ReConnect Program through annual appropriations acts; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136); and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58).  Congress appropriated \\\\$600 million for the program in FY2018, \\\\$550 million in FY2019, \\\\$655 million in FY2020, and \\\\$635 million in FY2021 through appropriations acts.  Congress appropriated approximately \\\\$2.363 billion for the ReConnect Program in FY2022.  Congress appropriated \\\\$1.926 billion through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58, Division J, Title I) and \\\\$436.605 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103).  As of December 2022, RUS has awarded \\\\$3.127 billion in ReConnect Program funding for 282 projects in 43 states and U.S. territories through three rounds of funding.  Congress and some stakeholders have identified issues related to the ReConnect Program, including funding levels, extent of service to rural areas, and the potential for duplication of broadband networks.  In addition to P.L. 117-58, seven other bills introduced in the 117th Congress would affect the ReConnect Program.  The bills would combine the ReConnect Program and Rural Broadband Program (H.R. 4374, H.R. 3369), add safeguards to avoid duplication across ReConnect projects and other federally funded broadband projects (H.R. 3435, H.R. 4825, S. 944), and expand the allowable activities that could be funded through the ReConnect Program (H.R. 2400, H.R. 3654).  Additional policy options Congress could consider regarding the ReConnect Program might include addressing broadband affordability in rural areas and training and education to increase broadband adoption among rural residents.

Benson** In 2018, Congress provided the Secretary of Agriculture authority to establish a new broadband Analyst in Agricultural loan and grant pilot program (the ReConnect Program) to help close the digital divide and expand Policy broadband deployment in rural areas.  The Federal Communications Commission found in 2019 that approximately 14.5 million Americans lack access to broadband, and more than 11 million of them live in rural areas.  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights this gap between those with access to broadband and those without access, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d For-profit internet service providers supply the majority of broadband access in the United States.  These providers typically build the infrastructure needed to deploy broadband to premises within their service areas.  Internet service providers charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.  Providers tend to deploy broadband to areas where they can reach a high number of people at the lowest cost.  Thus, they tend to avoid deploying broadband to areas with high infrastructure costs and small populations, such as rural areas.  Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141).  The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in eligible rural service areas.  Under the current round of funding, *eligible service areas* are defined as areas where 90% or more of households lack broadband access at speeds of at least 100 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload (i.e., 100/20 Mbps).  ReConnect projects are to provide broadband access to all premises within their service areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps.  Congress has provided funding for the ReConnect Program through annual appropriations acts; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136); and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58).  Congress appropriated \\\\$600 million for the program in FY2018, \\\\$550 million in FY2019, \\\\$655 million in FY2020, and \\\\$635 million in FY2021 through appropriations acts.  Congress appropriated approximately \\\\$2.363 billion for the ReConnect Program in FY2022.  Congress appropriated \\\\$1.926 billion through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58, Division J, Title I) and \\\\$436.605 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103).  As of December 2022, RUS has awarded \\\\$3.127 billion in ReConnect Program funding for 282 projects in 43 states and U.S. territories through three rounds of funding.  Congress and some stakeholders have identified issues related to the ReConnect Program, including funding levels, extent of service to rural areas, and the potential for duplication of broadband networks.  In addition to P.L. 117-58, seven other bills introduced in the 117th Congress would affect the ReConnect Program.  The bills would combine the ReConnect Program and Rural Broadband Program (H.R. 4374, H.R. 3369), add safeguards to avoid duplication across ReConnect projects and other federally funded broadband projects (H.R. 3435, H.R. 4825, S. 944), and expand the allowable activities that could be funded through the ReConnect Program (H.R. 2400, H.R. 3654).  Additional policy options Congress could consider regarding the ReConnect Program might include addressing broadband affordability in rural areas and training and education to increase broadband adoption among rural residents.

The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the ReConnect Program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in rural communities.  This report explores \\uf0b7 broadband access in rural America; \\uf0b7 the ReConnect Program (i.e., program authority, funding, and awards); \\uf0b7 comparisons between the ReConnect Program and other USDA broadband programs; \\uf0b7 the program\u2019s effectiveness and related factors; \\uf0b7 bills proposed by the 117th Congress that would affect the program; and \\uf0b7 potential policy options related to the ReConnect program.  **Broadband Access in Rural America** The FCC found that in 2019, an estimated 17% of people living in rural areas in the United States lacked broadband access, and 1% of people living in urban areas lacked broadband access.4 The FCC sets the performance speed benchmark that establishes the level at which fixed broadband service provides advanced telecommunications capabilities.  FCC uses this benchmark to determine whether areas have access to broadband.  The FCC set the performance speed benchmark at 25 megabits per second download and 3 megabits per second upload (25/3 Mbps).  Fixed broadband includes broadband provided through fiber optic cable, cable modem, digital subscriber line, fixed wireless, and satellite.  Researchers have identified three factors that contribute to the digital divide between rural and urban areas: 1.  **Cost. ** It is more expensive to build and maintain broadband infrastructure in rural areas compared with urban areas.  1 Federal Communications Commission (FCC), *Fourteenth Broadband Deployment Report*, FCC 21-18, January 19, 2021.  That report is in response to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires the FCC to report annually on whether advanced telecommunications are being deployed to all Americans and to take action if not.  2 John Lai and Nicole O.

The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that it costs an average of \\\\$27,000 to build one mile of fiber broadband infrastructure.7  ISPs charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.8  Rural areas often are geographically large and can include rough terrain, such as mountains. Building broadband infrastructure in rural areas is often more expensive than in urban areas.9  In addition, rural areas have lower populations than urban areas, which often results in fewer potential customers to pay monthly user fees.  Researchers have identified three operating models for deploying broadband to rural areas.10 \\uf0b7 The *retail model* involves a single entity that builds, owns, and operates the broadband network, and it is the most common model in the United States.  This model is impacted by customer density, which is low in rural America. The cost to the entity to provide service is often high for each customer when customers are spread out geographically.  For some, a potential advantage of this model is that a single entity can make all of the profit from operating the business.  A disadvantage could be that a single entity has to take on all of the risk if the business does to succeed.  \\uf0b7 The *open-access model* involves an entity\u2014typically a government entity, such as a municipality\u2014building and owning the broadband network.  The network owner provides network access to multiple ISPs, which then provide retail broadband service to customers.  An advantage of this model, some say, is that customers receive a variety of choices for their broadband service.  A potential disadvantage is that most municipalities operating open-access networks do not generate sufficient revenue to pay for the cost of building the network.  \\uf0b7 The *public-private partnership model* involves a municipality and a commercial ISP working together to deploy broadband to an area.  An advantage of this 5 See CRS Report R46613, *The Digital Divide: What Is It, Where Is It, and Federal Assistance Programs*, by Colby Leigh Rachfal; and Pew Research Center, \u201cInternet/Broadband Fact Sheet,\u201d accessed October 28, 2021, at https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/.  6 CRS Report R46108, *Demand for Broadband in Rural Areas: Implications for Universal Access*, by Brian E.

        "text": "*USDA\u2019s ReConnect Program: Expanding Rural Broadband* model, according to some, is that the private and public entities can work together to raise the funds needed to build the network.  A possible disadvantage is that public and private entities may have different goals for the broadband project.  Commercial ISPs likely would be focused on generating a profit, while government entities may be focused on providing value to their community and offering low broadband service rates.  **Low Demand for Service** The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has studied internet *adoption* in U.S. homes in both rural and urban areas.11  NTIA calculated how many people had access to broadband service (231 million people) and the portion of those people who elected to subscribe to broadband service.  NTIA found about 76% of people in rural areas use the internet in their homes, compared with 87% of people in urban areas. Research has identified three factors that may contribute to broadband adoption: age, educational attainment, and income level.12  The USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) found that rural residents tend to be older, have lower educational attainment, and lower incomes compared with urban residents\u2014all characteristics that could contribute to lower levels of broadband adoption.13  Studies have shown that broadband usage increases for rural residents when they identify essential tasks that can be completed using the internet.14  Essential tasks include working remotely and helping children access e-learning.15  In those cases, rural residents reportedly will expend to access the internet, including driving to the parking lots of restaurants, libraries, and schools to access free Wi-Fi.  **ReConnect Program** Congress provided authority to USDA to establish the ReConnect Program to address the digital divide in the United States and facilitate broadband deployment in rural areas. The program provides funding for ISPs and other entities to help offset the cost of building broadband infrastructure in rural areas.  This section provides an overview of the program authority, funding, and awards.  It also compares and contrasts the ReConnect Program with other USDA broadband programs.  **Program Authority** On March 23, 2018, Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division A, Title VII, \u00a7779).
