        "text": "## Background: Broadband and Rural America\\n The broadband loan and grant programs at RUS are intended to accelerate the deployment of broadband services in rural America.  \"Broadband\" refers to high-speed internet access and advanced telecommunications services for private homes, commercial establishments, schools, and public institutions.  Currently in the United States, residential broadband is primarily provided via cable modem (from the local provider of cable television service), fiber-optic cable, mobile wireless (e.g., smartphones), or over the copper telephone line (digital subscriber line or \"DSL\").  Other broadband technologies include fixed wireless and satellite.\\n Broadband access enables a number of beneficial applications to individual users and to communities.  These include ecommerce, telecommuting, voice service (voice over the internet protocol or \"VOIP\"), distance learning, telemedicine, public safety, and others.  It is becoming generally accepted that broadband access in a community can play an important role in economic development.\\n Access to affordable broadband is viewed as particularly important for the economic development of rural areas because it enables individuals and businesses to participate fully in the online economy regardless of geographical location.  For example, aside from enabling existing businesses to remain in their rural locations, broadband access could attract new business enterprises drawn by lower costs and a more desirable lifestyle.  Essentially, broadband potentially allows businesses and individuals in rural America to live locally while competing globally in an online environment.  A 2016 study from the Hudson Institute found that rural broadband providers directly and indirectly added \\\\$24.1 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015.  The rural broadband industry supported 69,595 jobs in 2015, both through its own employment and the employment that its purchases of goods and services generated.  [1]\\n Given the large potential impact broadband may have on the economic development of rural America, concern has been raised over a \"digital divide\" between rural and urban or suburban areas with respect to broadband deployment.  While there are many examples of rural communities with state-of-the-art telecommunications facilities, [2] recent surveys and studies have indicated that, in general, rural areas tend to lag behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment.  For example\\n \\n- According to the Federal Communications Commission\\\"s (FCC\\\"s)\\n   *Communications Marketplace Report*, \"As of year-end 2017, 94% of the overall population had coverage \\\\[of fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps\\\\], up from 91.9% in 2016.  Nonetheless, the gap in rural and Tribal America remains notable: 24% of Americans in rural areas and 32% of Americans in Tribal lands lack coverage from fixed terrestrial 25 Mbps/3 Mbps broadband, as compared to only 1.5% of Americans in urban areas.  The data demonstrate, however, that the gap between urban and rural or Tribal areas has narrowed each year over the last five years. \" [3] \\n- Also according to the FCC\\\"s *Communications Market Report*, rural\\n   areas continue to lag behind urban areas in mobile broadband deployment.  Although evaluated urban areas saw an increase of 10 Mbps/3 Mbps mobile LTE from 81.9% in 2014 to 92.6% in 2017, such deployment in evaluated rural areas remained relatively flat at about 70%.  [4] \\n- According to January 2018 survey data from the Pew Research Center,\\n   58% of adults in rural areas said they have a high-speed broadband connection at home, as opposed to 67% of adults in urban areas and 70% of adults in suburban areas.  [5] \\n- A November 2017 Census Bureau survey reported by the National\\n   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Digital Nation Data Explorer showed 72.9% of rural residents reporting using the internet, versus 78.5% of urban residents. [6] According to NTIA, the data \"indicates a fairly constant 6-9 percentage point gap between rural and urban communities\\\" internet use over time. \" [7]\\n The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas.  Particularly for wireline broadband technologies\u2014such as cable modem, fiber, and DSL\u2014the greater the geographical distances among customers, the larger the cost to serve those customers.  Thus, there is often less incentive for companies to invest in broadband in rural areas than, for example, in an urban area where there is more demand (more customers with perhaps higher incomes) and less cost to wire the market area.\\n The terrain of rural areas can also be a hindrance, in that it is more expensive to deploy broadband technologies in a mountainous or heavily forested area.  An additional added cost factor for remote areas can be the expense of \"backhaul\" (e.g., the \"middle mile\"), which refers to the installation of a dedicated line that transmits a signal to and from an internet backbone, which is typically located in or near an urban area.\\n Another important broadband availability issue is the extent to which there are multiple broadband providers offering competition and consumer choice.  Typically, multiple providers are more prevalent in urban than in rural areas.  [8] `\\[RL33816__6___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Rural Broadband Programs at the Rural Utilities Service\\n Because private providers are unlikely to earn enough revenue to cover the costs of deploying and operating broadband networks in many unserved rural areas, it is unlikely that private investment alone will bring service to these areas.  [9] In 2000, given the lagging deployment of broadband in rural areas, Congress and the Administration acted to initiate pilot broadband loan and grant programs within the Rural Utilities Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  While RUS had long maintained telecommunications loan and grant programs (Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, Rural Telephone Bank, and more recently, the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Loans and Grants), none were exclusively dedicated to financing rural broadband deployment.  Title III of the FY2001 agriculture appropriations bill ([P.L. 106-387](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d106:FLD002:@1(106+387))) directed USDA/RUS to conduct a \"pilot program to finance broadband transmission and local dial-up Internet service in areas that meet the definition of \\\"rural area\\\" used for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program. \"\\n Subsequently, on December 5, 2000, RUS announced the availability of \\\\$100 million in loan funding through a one-year pilot program \"to finance the construction and installation of broadband telecommunications services in rural America. \" [10] The broadband pilot loan program was authorized under the authority of the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program (7 U.S.C. 950aaa), and was available to \"legally organized entities\" not located within the boundaries of a city or town having a population in excess of 20,000.\\n The FY2002 agriculture appropriations bill ([P.L. 107-76](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d107:FLD002:@1(107+76))) designated a loan level of \\\\$80 million for broadband loans, and on January 23, 2002, RUS announced that the pilot program would be extended into FY2002, with \\\\$80 million in loans made available to fund many of the applications that did not receive funding during the previous year. [11]\\n Meanwhile, the FY2002 agriculture appropriations bill ([P.L. 107-76](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d107:FLD002:@1(107+76))) allocated \\\\$20 million for a pilot broadband grant program, also authorized under the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program.  On July 8, 2002, RUS announced the availability of \\\\$20 million for a pilot grant program for the provision of broadband service in rural America. The program was specifically targeted to economically challenged rural communities with no existing broadband service.  Grants were made available to entities providing \"community-oriented connectivity,\" which the RUS defined as those entities \"who will connect the critical community facilities including the local schools, libraries, hospitals, police, fire and rescue services and who will operate a community center that provides free and open access to residents. \" [12]\\n The pilot program was extended into FY2003, as the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003 ([P.L. 108-7](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d108:FLD002:@1(108+7))) allocated \\\\$10 million for broadband grants.\\n Currently, RUS has four ongoing programs that have been established to incentivize and subsidize broadband infrastructure investment in unserved and underserved rural areas.  These include the following:\\n \\n- *Rural Broadband Access Loans*\u2014funds the costs of construction,\\n   improvement, or acquisition of facilities and equipment needed to provide service in eligible rural areas. \\n- *Community Connect Grants*\u2014funds broadband deployment into rural\\n   communities where it is not yet economically viable for private sector providers to deliver service. \\n- *Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans* *and Loan Guarantees*\u2014funds\\n   the construction, maintenance, improvement, and expansion of telephone service and broadband in extremely rural areas with a population of 5,000 or less. \\n- *Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants*\u2014principally funds end-user\\n   equipment to help rural communities use telecommunications to link teachers and medical service providers in one area to students and patients in another.\\n In addition, a new broadband loan and grant pilot program\u2014the ReConnect Program\u2014has been established and funded at \\\\$600 million by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ([P.L. 115-141](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+141))).\\n  in the Appendix shows the total amount and number of awards provided by the RUS broadband programs for each state between FY2009 and FY2016.\\n In its April 2017 report, *Rural Broadband Deployment: Improved Consistency with Leading Practices Could Enhance Management of Loan and Grant Programs*, GAO reported that (according to RUS data) since FY2004, RUS has approved 704 broadband projects totaling almost \\\\$8.6 billion in loans and \\\\$144.8 million in grants to deploy telecommunications or broadband infrastructure networks in rural areas.

The program was first authorized in 1949 to finance rural telephone service.  Since 1995, RUS has required that networks funded by this program offer broadband service as well.\\n Loans and loan guarantees are available only to rural areas and towns with a population of 5,000 or less.  Eligible areas are those without telecommunications facilities or areas where the applicant is the recognized telecommunications provider.  Funded projects cannot duplicate existing services.\\n The program is authorized to provide several different types of financing, including\\n \\n- direct Treasury rate loans, which bear interest at the government\"s\\n   cost of money (or the current Treasury rate).  Thus, the interest charged varies with the Treasury rate.  As Treasury rates increase, so does the cost to the borrower for these loans. \\n- guaranteed loans, which are provided to borrowers of a nongovernment\\n   lender or from the Federal Financing Bank (FFB).  The interest rate charged on FFB loans is the Treasury rate plus an administrative fee of one-eighth of 1%.  The terms of these loans may vary significantly and allow borrowers more flexibility in meeting their financing needs. \\n- hardship direct loans, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 5% per\\n   year.  These loans are intended only for borrowers with extremely high investment costs in terms of per subscriber service.  These borrowers also have a very low number of subscribers for each mile of telecommunications line constructed.  This low subscriber density inherently increases the cost to serve the most sparsely populated rural areas.  Because of the high cost of the investment needed, these borrowers cannot typically afford higher interest rate loans. [20]\\n The annual loan level for the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee Program is \\\\$690 million.  Currently, the 5% hardship loans are not offered\u2014because of low interest rates, the Treasury and FFB loans can currently offer lower interest rates than the 5% offered by hardship loans. `\\[RL33816__10___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Impact of Universal Service Reform on RUS Broadband Loan Programs\\n RUS has three programs that provide or have provided loans for broadband infrastructure projects: the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee program (also known as the Farm Bill broadband loan program), the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP under the ARRA), and the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program (established in 1949 as the Rural Telephone Loan and Loan Guarantee program). [25]\\n Whereas RUS broadband loans are used as up-front capital to invest in broadband infrastructure, the Federal Communications Commission\\\"s (FCC\\\"s) Universal Service Fund (USF)\u2014specifically, the high cost fund\u2014has functioned as an ongoing subsidy to keep the operation of telecommunications networks in high cost areas profitable for providers. Many RUS telecommunications and broadband borrowers (loan recipients) receive high cost USF subsidies.  In many cases, the subsidy received from USF helps provide the revenue necessary to keep the loan viable. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program is highly dependent on high cost USF revenues, with 99% (476 out of 480 borrowers) receiving interstate high cost USF support.  This is not surprising, given that the RUS Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans are available only to the most rural and high cost areas (towns with populations less than 5,000). Regarding broadband loans, 60% of BIP (stimulus) borrowers draw from state or interstate USF support mechanisms, while 10% of Farm Bill (Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program) broadband borrowers receive interstate high cost USF support. [26]\\n The FCC, in an October 2011 decision, adopted an order that calls for the USF to be transformed, in stages, over a multiyear period\u2014from a mechanism to support voice telephone service to one that supports the deployment, adoption, and use of both fixed and mobile broadband.  More specifically, the high cost program is being phased out and a new fund, the Connect America Fund (CAF), which includes the targeted Mobility Fund and new Remote Areas Fund, is replacing it. [27]\\n During this transition, the uncertainty surrounding the FCC\\\"s proposed methodology for distributing Connect America Fund monies has led many small rural providers to postpone or cancel investment in broadband network upgrades.  [28] According to RUS, \"demand for RUS loans dropped to roughly 37% of the total amount of loan funds appropriated by Congress in FY2012,\" and \"\\\\[c\\\\]urrent and prospective RUS borrowers have communicated their hesitation to increase their outstanding debt and move forward with planned construction due to the recently implemented reductions in USF support and Inter-Carrier Compensation (ICC) payments. \" [29] `\\[RL33816__16___1\\]`"

Up to \\\\$80 million will be directed toward the Appalachian region.  According to the Administration, the new account \"combines the Rural Development grant programs into one account to provide the Administration with the flexibility to place resources where significant impact can be made for economic infrastructure development. \" [32]\\n On July 12, 2017, the House Appropriations Committee approved the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 ([H.R. 3268](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/z?d115:H.R.3268:); [H.Rept. 115-232](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/cpquery/R? cp115:FLD010:@1(hr232):)). The bill provided \\\\$4.521 million to subsidize a loan level of \\\\$26.991 million for the broadband loan program.  Funding provided for the broadband loan program was intended to promote availability in those areas where there is not otherwise a business case for private investment in a broadband network.  The committee directed RUS to focus expenditures on projects that bring broadband service to underserved households and areas.\\n The House bill provided \\\\$122.692 million for the new Rural Economic Infrastructure Account (24% below the Administration request), which would include both Community Connect and DLT grants, along with Community Facilities grants and Home Repair grants.  The bill included language requiring at least 15% of the account resources (\\\\$18.4 million) be allocated to each program area.  The committee noted that tribal communities continue to struggle with gaining access to broadband service, and encouraged the Secretary to provide a report that identifies the specific challenges Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) have in gaining access to broadband service and provide a plan for addressing these challenges, including how the Community Connect program can assist ITOs.\\n Regarding telecommunications loans, the House matched the Administration proposal, providing a loan level of \\\\$690 million (\\\\$345 million in direct Treasury loans and \\\\$345 million in FFB loans) with an appropriation of \\\\$0.863 million to subsidize direct Treasury loans.\\n Additionally, the House Appropriations Committee report directed USDA to continue coordinating with the FCC, NTIA, and other related federal agencies to ensure that policies tied to one federal program do not undermine the objectives and functionality of another.  The committee directed the department to prepare a report, in collaboration with the FCC and DOC, detailing areas of responsibility toward addressing rural broadband issues.  The report shall include, but not be limited to, how the programs work complimentarily to one another; how they address broadband issues in unserved and underserved areas, including tribal lands; identify barriers to infrastructure investment in rural areas and tribal lands; data speeds which fixed, wireless, and mobile broadband users in rural areas and tribal lands experience; and cost estimates to increase speeds to 25 Mbps in unserved communities and communities currently being served by speeds less than 25 Mbps.\\n On July 20, 2017, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version of the FY2018 agriculture appropriations bill ([S. 1603](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/z?d115:S.1603:); [S.Rept. 115-131](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/cpquery/R? cp115:FLD010:@1(sr131):)). The bill provided \\\\$4.53 million to subsidize a loan level of \\\\$27.043 million for the broadband loan program, \\\\$30 million for the Community Connect grant program, and \\\\$26.6 million for DLT grants.  Unlike the House and the Administration request, the committee did not include funding for Rural Economic Infrastructure grants.  For telecommunications loans, the Senate matched the House bill and the Administration proposal, providing a loan level of \\\\$690 million (\\\\$345 million in direct Treasury loans and \\\\$345 million in FFB loans) with an appropriation of \\\\$0.863 million to subsidize direct Treasury loans.\\n Regarding the broadband loan program, the committee encouraged RUS to focus expenditures on projects that bring broadband service to currently unserved households, and directed RUS to report back to the committee on administrative efforts to eliminate duplicative or overbuilding of broadband technology.  The committee also recommended that USDA explore a pilot grant program to demonstrate the use of multistrand fiber-optic cable that exists as part of electrical transmission infrastructure to provide state-of-the-art broadband services to currently underserved rural schools and medical centers within a mile of the existing cable.\\n The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ([P.L. 115-141](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+141))) provided \\\\$5 million to subsidize a broadband loan level of \\\\$29.851 million, \\\\$30 million to Community Connect broadband grants, and \\\\$49 million for DLT grants, which included an additional \\\\$20 million to address the opioid epidemic in rural America.

The IG report found that \"RUS has not ensured that communities without broadband service receive first priority for loans,\" and that although RUS has a system in place to prioritize loans to unserved communities, the system \"lacks a cutoff date and functions as a rolling selection process\u2014priorities are decided based on the applicants who happen to be in the pool at any given moment. \" [50] The result is that a significant number of communities with some level of preexisting broadband service have received loans.  According to the IG report, of 11 loans awarded in 2004, 66% of the associated communities served by those loans had existing service.  According to RUS, 31% of communities served by all loans (during the period 2003 through early 2005) had preexisting competitive service (not including loans used to upgrade or expand existing service).  [51] In some cases, according to the IG report, \"loans were issued to companies in highly competitive business environments where multiple providers competed for relatively few customers. \" [52] At the May 1, 2007, hearing before the House Subcommittee on Specialty Crops, Rural Development, and Foreign Agriculture, then-RUS Administrator James Andrews testified that of the 69 broadband loans awarded since the program\\\"s inception, 40% of the communities approved for funding were unserved at the time of loan approval, and an additional 15% had only one broadband provider.  [53]\\n Awarding loans to entities in communities with preexisting competitive service raised criticism from competitors who already offer broadband to those communities.  According to the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA), \"RUS loans are being used to unfairly subsidize second and third broadband providers in communities where private risk capital already has been invested to provide broadband service. \" [54] Critics argued that providing loans in areas with preexisting competitive broadband service creates an uneven playing field and discourages further private investment in rural broadband.  [55] In response, RUS stated in the IG report that its policies are in accordance with the statute, and that they address \"the need for competition to increase the quality of services and reduce the cost of those services to the consumer. \" [56] RUS argued that the presence of a competitor does not necessarily mean that an area is adequately served, and additionally, that in order for some borrowers to maintain a viable business in an unserved area, it may be necessary for that company to also be serving more densely populated rural areas where some level of competition already exists.

    "text": "**USDA\u2019s ReConnect Program: Expanding Rural** December 14, 2022 **Broadband** **Lisa S. Benson** In 2018, Congress provided the Secretary of Agriculture authority to establish a new broadband Analyst in Agricultural loan and grant pilot program (the ReConnect Program) to help close the digital divide and expand Policy broadband deployment in rural areas.  The Federal Communications Commission found in 2019 that approximately 14.5 million Americans lack access to broadband, and more than 11 million of them live in rural areas.  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights this gap between those with access to broadband and those without access, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d For-profit internet service providers supply the majority of broadband access in the United States.  These providers typically build the infrastructure needed to deploy broadband to premises within their service areas.  Internet service providers charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.  Providers tend to deploy broadband to areas where they can reach a high number of people at the lowest cost.  Thus, they tend to avoid deploying broadband to areas with high infrastructure costs and small populations, such as rural areas.  Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141).  The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in eligible rural service areas.  Under the current round of funding, *eligible service areas* are defined as areas where 90% or more of households lack broadband access at speeds of at least 100 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload (i.e., 100/20 Mbps).  ReConnect projects are to provide broadband access to all premises within their service areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps.  Congress has provided funding for the ReConnect Program through annual appropriations acts; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136); and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58).  Congress appropriated \\$600 million for the program in FY2018, \\$550 million in FY2019, \\$655 million in FY2020, and \\$635 million in FY2021 through appropriations acts.  Congress appropriated approximately \\$2.363 billion for the ReConnect Program in FY2022.  Congress appropriated \\$1.926 billion through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58, Division J, Title I) and \\$436.605 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103).  As of December 2022, RUS has awarded \\$3.127 billion in ReConnect Program funding for 282 projects in 43 states and U.S. territories through three rounds of funding.  Congress and some stakeholders have identified issues related to the ReConnect Program, including funding levels, extent of service to rural areas, and the potential for duplication of broadband networks.  In addition to P.L. 117-58, seven other bills introduced in the 117th Congress would affect the ReConnect Program.  The bills would combine the ReConnect Program and Rural Broadband Program (H.R. 4374, H.R. 3369), add safeguards to avoid duplication across ReConnect projects and other federally funded broadband projects (H.R. 3435, H.R. 4825, S. 944), and expand the allowable activities that could be funded through the ReConnect Program (H.R. 2400, H.R. 3654).  Additional policy options Congress could consider regarding the ReConnect Program might include addressing broadband affordability in rural areas and training and education to increase broadband adoption among rural residents.

    "sections": "{'1': '**USDA\u2019s ReConnect Program: Expanding Rural** December 14, 2022 **Broadband** **Lisa S. Benson** In 2018, Congress provided the Secretary of Agriculture authority to establish a new broadband Analyst in Agricultural loan and grant pilot program (the ReConnect Program) to help close the digital divide and expand Policy broadband deployment in rural areas.  The Federal Communications Commission found in 2019 that approximately 14.5 million Americans lack access to broadband, and more than 11 million of them live in rural areas.  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights this gap between those with access to broadband and those without access, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d For-profit internet service providers supply the majority of broadband access in the United States.  These providers typically build the infrastructure needed to deploy broadband to premises within their service areas.  Internet service providers charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.  Providers tend to deploy broadband to areas where they can reach a high number of people at the lowest cost.  Thus, they tend to avoid deploying broadband to areas with high infrastructure costs and small populations, such as rural areas.  Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141).  The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in eligible rural service areas.  Under the current round of funding, *eligible service areas* are defined as areas where 90% or more of households lack broadband access at speeds of at least 100 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload (i.e., 100/20 Mbps).  ReConnect projects are to provide broadband access to all premises within their service areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps.  Congress has provided funding for the ReConnect Program through annual appropriations acts; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136); and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58).  Congress appropriated \\\\$600 million for the program in FY2018, \\\\$550 million in FY2019, \\\\$655 million in FY2020, and \\\\$635 million in FY2021 through appropriations acts.  Congress appropriated approximately \\\\$2.363 billion for the ReConnect Program in FY2022.  Congress appropriated \\\\$1.926 billion through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58, Division J, Title I) and \\\\$436.605 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103).  As of December 2022, RUS has awarded \\\\$3.127 billion in ReConnect Program funding for 282 projects in 43 states and U.S. territories through three rounds of funding.  Congress and some stakeholders have identified issues related to the ReConnect Program, including funding levels, extent of service to rural areas, and the potential for duplication of broadband networks.  In addition to P.L. 117-58, seven other bills introduced in the 117th Congress would affect the ReConnect Program.  The bills would combine the ReConnect Program and Rural Broadband Program (H.R. 4374, H.R. 3369), add safeguards to avoid duplication across ReConnect projects and other federally funded broadband projects (H.R. 3435, H.R. 4825, S. 944), and expand the allowable activities that could be funded through the ReConnect Program (H.R. 2400, H.R. 3654).  Additional policy options Congress could consider regarding the ReConnect Program might include addressing broadband affordability in rural areas and training and education to increase broadband adoption among rural residents.

        "text": "**USDA\u2019s ReConnect Program: Expanding Rural** December 14, 2022 **Broadband** **Lisa S. Benson** In 2018, Congress provided the Secretary of Agriculture authority to establish a new broadband Analyst in Agricultural loan and grant pilot program (the ReConnect Program) to help close the digital divide and expand Policy broadband deployment in rural areas.  The Federal Communications Commission found in 2019 that approximately 14.5 million Americans lack access to broadband, and more than 11 million of them live in rural areas.  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights this gap between those with access to broadband and those without access, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d For-profit internet service providers supply the majority of broadband access in the United States.  These providers typically build the infrastructure needed to deploy broadband to premises within their service areas.  Internet service providers charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.  Providers tend to deploy broadband to areas where they can reach a high number of people at the lowest cost.  Thus, they tend to avoid deploying broadband to areas with high infrastructure costs and small populations, such as rural areas.  Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141).  The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in eligible rural service areas.  Under the current round of funding, *eligible service areas* are defined as areas where 90% or more of households lack broadband access at speeds of at least 100 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload (i.e., 100/20 Mbps).  ReConnect projects are to provide broadband access to all premises within their service areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps.  Congress has provided funding for the ReConnect Program through annual appropriations acts; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136); and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58).  Congress appropriated \\\\$600 million for the program in FY2018, \\\\$550 million in FY2019, \\\\$655 million in FY2020, and \\\\$635 million in FY2021 through appropriations acts.  Congress appropriated approximately \\\\$2.363 billion for the ReConnect Program in FY2022.  Congress appropriated \\\\$1.926 billion through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58, Division J, Title I) and \\\\$436.605 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103).  As of December 2022, RUS has awarded \\\\$3.127 billion in ReConnect Program funding for 282 projects in 43 states and U.S. territories through three rounds of funding.  Congress and some stakeholders have identified issues related to the ReConnect Program, including funding levels, extent of service to rural areas, and the potential for duplication of broadband networks.  In addition to P.L. 117-58, seven other bills introduced in the 117th Congress would affect the ReConnect Program.  The bills would combine the ReConnect Program and Rural Broadband Program (H.R. 4374, H.R. 3369), add safeguards to avoid duplication across ReConnect projects and other federally funded broadband projects (H.R. 3435, H.R. 4825, S. 944), and expand the allowable activities that could be funded through the ReConnect Program (H.R. 2400, H.R. 3654).  Additional policy options Congress could consider regarding the ReConnect Program might include addressing broadband affordability in rural areas and training and education to increase broadband adoption among rural residents.

        "text": "*USDA\u2019s ReConnect Program: Expanding Rural Broadband* **Introduction** According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), approximately 14.5 million Americans lack access to broadband, and more than 11 million of those Americans live in rural areas.1  Some stakeholders have viewed access to broadband (i.e., high-speed internet) at home as critical during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.2  Consequently, the pandemic has highlighted the gap between people with access to broadband and those without access, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d3 In 2018, Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program to help close the digital divide and expand broadband deployment in rural areas.  The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the ReConnect Program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in rural communities.  This report explores \\uf0b7 broadband access in rural America; \\uf0b7 the ReConnect Program (i.e., program authority, funding, and awards); \\uf0b7 comparisons between the ReConnect Program and other USDA broadband programs; \\uf0b7 the program\u2019s effectiveness and related factors; \\uf0b7 bills proposed by the 117th Congress that would affect the program; and \\uf0b7 potential policy options related to the ReConnect program.  **Broadband Access in Rural America** The FCC found that in 2019, an estimated 17% of people living in rural areas in the United States lacked broadband access, and 1% of people living in urban areas lacked broadband access.4 The FCC sets the performance speed benchmark that establishes the level at which fixed broadband service provides advanced telecommunications capabilities.  FCC uses this benchmark to determine whether areas have access to broadband.  The FCC set the performance speed benchmark at 25 megabits per second download and 3 megabits per second upload (25/3 Mbps).  Fixed broadband includes broadband provided through fiber optic cable, cable modem, digital subscriber line, fixed wireless, and satellite.  Researchers have identified three factors that contribute to the digital divide between rural and urban areas: 1.  **Cost. ** It is more expensive to build and maintain broadband infrastructure in rural areas compared with urban areas.  1 Federal Communications Commission (FCC), *Fourteenth Broadband Deployment Report*, FCC 21-18, January 19, 2021.

The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that it costs an average of \\\\$27,000 to build one mile of fiber broadband infrastructure.7  ISPs charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.8  Rural areas often are geographically large and can include rough terrain, such as mountains. Building broadband infrastructure in rural areas is often more expensive than in urban areas.9  In addition, rural areas have lower populations than urban areas, which often results in fewer potential customers to pay monthly user fees.  Researchers have identified three operating models for deploying broadband to rural areas.10 \\uf0b7 The *retail model* involves a single entity that builds, owns, and operates the broadband network, and it is the most common model in the United States.  This model is impacted by customer density, which is low in rural America. The cost to the entity to provide service is often high for each customer when customers are spread out geographically.  For some, a potential advantage of this model is that a single entity can make all of the profit from operating the business.  A disadvantage could be that a single entity has to take on all of the risk if the business does to succeed.  \\uf0b7 The *open-access model* involves an entity\u2014typically a government entity, such as a municipality\u2014building and owning the broadband network.  The network owner provides network access to multiple ISPs, which then provide retail broadband service to customers.  An advantage of this model, some say, is that customers receive a variety of choices for their broadband service.  A potential disadvantage is that most municipalities operating open-access networks do not generate sufficient revenue to pay for the cost of building the network.  \\uf0b7 The *public-private partnership model* involves a municipality and a commercial ISP working together to deploy broadband to an area.  An advantage of this 5 See CRS Report R46613, *The Digital Divide: What Is It, Where Is It, and Federal Assistance Programs*, by Colby Leigh Rachfal; and Pew Research Center, \u201cInternet/Broadband Fact Sheet,\u201d accessed October 28, 2021, at https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/.  6 CRS Report R46108, *Demand for Broadband in Rural Areas: Implications for Universal Access*, by Brian E.

        "text": "*USDA\u2019s ReConnect Program: Expanding Rural Broadband* model, according to some, is that the private and public entities can work together to raise the funds needed to build the network.  A possible disadvantage is that public and private entities may have different goals for the broadband project.  Commercial ISPs likely would be focused on generating a profit, while government entities may be focused on providing value to their community and offering low broadband service rates.  **Low Demand for Service** The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has studied internet *adoption* in U.S. homes in both rural and urban areas.11  NTIA calculated how many people had access to broadband service (231 million people) and the portion of those people who elected to subscribe to broadband service.  NTIA found about 76% of people in rural areas use the internet in their homes, compared with 87% of people in urban areas. Research has identified three factors that may contribute to broadband adoption: age, educational attainment, and income level.12  The USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) found that rural residents tend to be older, have lower educational attainment, and lower incomes compared with urban residents\u2014all characteristics that could contribute to lower levels of broadband adoption.13  Studies have shown that broadband usage increases for rural residents when they identify essential tasks that can be completed using the internet.14  Essential tasks include working remotely and helping children access e-learning.15  In those cases, rural residents reportedly will expend to access the internet, including driving to the parking lots of restaurants, libraries, and schools to access free Wi-Fi.  **ReConnect Program** Congress provided authority to USDA to establish the ReConnect Program to address the digital divide in the United States and facilitate broadband deployment in rural areas. The program provides funding for ISPs and other entities to help offset the cost of building broadband infrastructure in rural areas.  This section provides an overview of the program authority, funding, and awards.  It also compares and contrasts the ReConnect Program with other USDA broadband programs.  **Program Authority** On March 23, 2018, Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division A, Title VII, \u00a7779).

Eligible applicants include corporations, cooperatives, public entities, U.S. territories, and Indian tribes as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Act (25 U.S.C. \u00a7450b).  ReConnect projects must meet the following criteria:20 \\uf0b7 *Serve rural areas. * Proposed service areas must be in rural areas.  The program regulations define *rural area* as any area that is not located within a city, town, or incorporated area that has a population of greater than 20,000 inhabitants or an urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or town that has a population of greater than 50,000 inhabitants (7 C.F.R. \u00a71740.2).  \\uf0b7 *Serve areas without sufficient broadband access. * At least 90% of households within the proposed service areas must lack sufficient broadband access.  The most recent program Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) defines *sufficient access to broadband* as any rural area in which households have fixed, terrestrial broadband service defined as 100 megabits per second (Mbps) downstream and 20 Mbps upstream.  This is often referred to as 100/20 Mbps.21  Applicants determine sufficient broadband service in selected locations by referring to the FCC broadband deployment map.22 \\uf0b7 *Offer service to all premises. * The most recent FOA requires applicants to build a network capable of providing broadband service to all premises within the proposed service areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps downstream and upstream (also known as \u201c100 Mbps symmetrical speed\u201d).23  RUS reviews completed applications for eligibility and ranks eligible applications using a point system.

For these reasons, RUS has instituted safeguards to ensure ReConnect projects do not overbuild or duplicate existing broadband networks.  RUS provides public notification of proposed ReConnect applications (7 C.F.R. \u00a71740.26) and posts information from the applications on a public website for 45 days.

The primary changes were to the definition of eligible service areas, priority point criteria, project buildout speeds, and matching fund requirements.  The Round 2 FOA defined eligible service areas as areas in which 90% of households did not have sufficient broadband access at speeds of at least 10/1 Mbps, whereas the Round 3 FOA defines eligible service areas as areas where 90% of households do not have sufficient broadband access at 100/20 Mbps.  This change is less restrictive than the previous definition, allowing more rural areas to qualify as eligible service areas than in Rounds 1 and 2. Round 3 prioritizes projects that propose to extend broadband to areas that lack service at speeds of at least 25/3 Mbps.  RUS also changed the priority point criteria for Round 3. Round 2 had nine priority criteria.  Round 3 removes eight of the Round 2 criteria, retaining the criterion for the rurality of the service area.  Priority points are awarded for projects serving the least populated rural areas as measured by the population of the service area per square mile or if a service area is located at least 100 miles from a city that has a population of greater than 50,000 people.  Round 3 added nine additional priority point criteria, including level of existing service, economic need of the communities, and affordability of service.  In addition, the Round 3 FOA increases the required buildout speed for funded projects.  The Round 2 FOA required that projects provide broadband access to the proposed areas at speeds of at least 25/3 Mbps.  Round 3 requires that projects provide broadband access to proposed areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps (i.e., 100 Mbps symmetrical speed).  The Round 3 FOA also removes the matching fund requirement for some areas and applicants.  The Round 2 FOA required that applicants applying for grants provide matching funds for at least 25% of the project costs.  The Round 3 FOA allows tribal government applicants proposing to provide service on their own lands to waive the matching funds requirement.  In addition, any projects in which the proposed service area is comprised of at least 75% socially vulnerable communities may waive the matching funds requirement.

The following section summarizes these issues.  **Funding Levels** Some stakeholders have argued that because the demand for ReConnect Program funds exceeds available funding, Congress might consider increasing program funding.42 Congress appropriated \\\\$100 million for the ReConnect Program through the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136).  USDA reviewed applications submitted to the ReConnect Program and funded nine of those applications using CARES Act funding.  The case could be made that, similar to the CARES Act funding, if Congress were to provide additional funding for the ReConnect Program, then additional qualified applications could be identified to be funded.  Conversely, some Members of Congress requested an audit of the ReConnect Program and cited that \u201cgovernment watchdogs have long raised concerns with USDA\u2019s management of its broadband infrastructure support programs. \u201d43 These Members expressed concern that without proper oversight of the program, there was the potential for overbuilding broadband networks.  **Serving Rural Areas** In 2020, certain Members of the Senate and House sent a letter to the Secretary of Agriculture stating that priority points offered on ReConnect applications favored rural areas with higher populations.44  In Round 1 and Round 2, RUS provided priority points for applications that would serve areas that included health care centers, educational facilities, and community facilities [(**Table 2**)](2022-12-14_R47017_a40122c2bc84a3e34f3fa4bbb1fe9d3eab857016.html#13). Some Members reasoned that these types of facilities were less likely to be located in less populated rural areas, concluding that applications serving rural areas with lower populations would be less competitive than applications serving rural areas with higher populations.45 42  Ben Nuelle, \u201cReaping Rural Broadband Rewards of USDA\u2019s ReConnect Program,\u201d *Agri-Pulse,* December 2, 2020; and Katie Kienbaum, \u201cReConnect Funding Applicants: More Than Half Community Broadband Networks,\u201d *Institute for Local Self-Reliance*, September 4, 2019.  43 Letter from House Committee on Energy and Commerce ranking member Rep.

        "text": "*USDA\u2019s ReConnect Program: Expanding Rural Broadband* **Potential Policy Options** Congress may consider policy options related to the ReConnect Program.  Policy options to increase program efficiency could focus on increasing broadband affordability and broadband adoption in rural communities.  The following section provides an overview of these potential policy options.  **Broadband Affordability** Congress may address rural broadband adoption by focusing on its affordability.  Researchers have found that broadband adoption is lower among rural residents compared with urban residents.51 Cost is one factor among others affecting broadband adoption.  To increase broadband adoption among rural residents, Congress might develop legislation to allow ReConnect funds to be used to make broadband service more affordable for rural residents.  For example, Congress might model potential legislation after the FCC Affordable Connectivity Program, which provides subsidies to ISPs to cover residential broadband service.  The monthly subsidies for providers are up to \\\\$30 per household and up to \\\\$75 per household on tribal lands in cases where the service cannot be maintained at the lower rate of \\\\$30 per household.52  Congress modified, extended, and renamed the FCC Emergency Broadband Benefit Program to create the Affordable Connectivity Program through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58).  Congress funded the FCC\u2019s Emergency Broadband Benefit Program through the Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund,53 which it established to help Americans afford internet service during the COVID-19 pandemic (P.L. 116-260, Division N, Title IX, \u00a7904).  If Congress were to consider this model for the ReConnect Program, it might also consider how to avoid the potential for duplication between any such use of the ReConnect Program and the Affordable Connectivity Program.  **Training and Education** Congress may address rural broadband expansion through training and education efforts.  Researchers have found that rural residents are more likely to access the internet when they identify essential tasks that they can complete using the internet, such as connecting virtually with suppliers and learning about community events or activities.54  To increase broadband adoption by rural residents, Congress might consider enacting legislation to allow ReConnect Program funds to be used for training programs that teach rural residents how to use the internet to accomplish essential tasks. For example, potential programs could provide training on tools that can be used for e-commerce and social media for small businesses.  Training programs could also help rural residents access job training and career opportunities, particularly for telework.  Congress might model any such legislation after USDA\u2019s DLT Program, which provides training and education to rural communities to enhance their interest and ability to participate in telehealth (7 U.S.C. 51 CRS Report R46108, *Demand for Broadband in Rural Areas: Implications for Universal Access*, by Brian E.

Congress could also use the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Workforce Opportunity for Rural Communities Initiative program as a model.55  The program provides grants to support workforce development activities that prepare rural workers for jobs in high-demand occupations that are aligned with a regional or community economic development strategy.  **Author Information** Lisa S.

        "text": "## Summary\\n Since the initial deployment of broadband in the late 1990s, Congress has viewed broadband infrastructure deployment as a means towards improving regional economic development, and in the long term, to create jobs.  According to the National Broadband Plan, the lack of adequate broadband infrastructure is most pressing in rural America, where the costs of serving large geographical areas, coupled with low population densities, often reduce economic incentives for telecommunications providers to invest in and maintain broadband infrastructure and service.\\n Historically, the federal government has provided financial assistance to give telecommunications providers the capital to invest in rural telecommunications infrastructure and to maintain an adequate return on their investment.  Currently, there are two ongoing federal vehicles which direct money to fund broadband in rural areas: the broadband and telecommunications programs at the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Universal Service Fund (USF) programs under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\\n While both the RUS and USF programs share some of the same goals (e.g., improving broadband availability and adoption in rural areas), the two programs are different with respect to their funding mechanism, scope, and emphasis.  For example, RUS grants and loans are used as up-front capital to invest in broadband infrastructure, while the USF provides ongoing subsidies to keep the operation of telecommunications and broadband networks in high cost areas economically viable for providers. Another key difference is that the RUS programs are funded through annual appropriations, while USF is funded through mandatory contributions from telecommunications carriers that provide interstate service, and is not subject to the annual congressional budget process.\\n Both programs are at a pivotal point in the 113 \\\\[th\\\\] Congress.  The statute authorizing the Rural Broadband Loan and Loan Guarantee program was significantly modified in the 2008 farm bill, and is being addressed once more in the 2013 farm bill.  Meanwhile, the USF is undergoing a major and unprecedented transition through a series of reforms being developed by the FCC, and Congress has adopted an oversight role with respect to those reforms.  In shaping and monitoring the future evolution of these programs, Congress is assessing how best to leverage these programs to ensure that the goals of the National Broadband Plan\u2014including universal broadband service by 2020\u2014are met to the greatest extent possible.\\n \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n \\n\\n Rural Broadband: The Roles of the Rural Utilities Service and the Universal Service Fund `\\[R42524__4___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Definition of \"Rural\"\\n The rural nature of an area or community served by grant and loan projects is a key characteristic of RUS telecommunications programs.  One of the primary strategic goals of the USDA is to \"assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self-sustaining, repopulating, and economically thriving. \" [7] While many rural telecommunications providers already have deployed broadband networks, studies, surveys, and data collections continue to show that broadband access, on average, is less adequate in rural areas than it is in suburban or urban communities.  [8]\\n The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas.  Particularly for wireline broadband technologies\u2014such as cable modem and DSL [9]\u2014the greater the geographical distances among customers, the larger the cost to serve those customers. Thus, there is often less incentive for companies to invest in broadband in rural areas than, for example, in an urban area where there is more demand (more customers with perhaps higher incomes) and less cost to wire the market area.\\n Given the RUS emphasis on \"rural\" broadband, the issue becomes: what level of \"rurality\" is necessary for an area to be eligible for RUS broadband grants or loans?  Within the RUS telecommunications portfolio, there is no standard definition of \"rural,\" with programs such as the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee program defining eligible rural areas as populations less than 20,000 (plus areas not in an urbanized area adjacent to a city of not more than 50,000), while the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan program defines eligible areas as populations of 5,000 or less (extremely rural areas).  Among all the RUS telecommunications programs, the different definitions of eligible service areas (which correspond to definitions of rurality) are presented in .\\n Shifting definitions of \"rural\" have generated controversy.  For example, during the first round of BIP awards, a separate category called \"remote areas\" was created, defined as an unserved rural area at least 50 miles from the limits of a non-rural area.  For last mile projects, [10] only remote areas were eligible for BIP grants (as opposed to loans or grant/loan combinations).  The remote area category was eliminated in the second round, due to criticism from many Members of Congress who argued that the remote rural definition excluded many areas of the country (primarily in the eastern half of the United States).\\n The definition of \"rural\" has also generated much controversy over the Rural Broadband Loan and Loan Guarantee program, particularly as Congress continues to refine the program through periodic consideration of the farm bill.  [11] Over the life of the broadband loan program, the definition of a rural area eligible for the program has been changed three separate times by Congress. [12] Ultimately, the definition of what constitutes a rural community is always a difficult issue for congressional policymakers in determining how to target rural communities for broadband assistance.  On the one hand, the narrower the definition the greater the possibility that deserving communities may be excluded.  On the other hand, the broader the definition used, the greater the possibility that communities not typically considered \"rural\" or \"underserved\" may be eligible for financial assistance.\\n During the 113 \\\\[th\\\\] Congress, the 2013 farm bill\u2014which would amend the statute authorizing the rural broadband loan and loan guarantee program\u2014explicitly addresses the rural definition issue.  For example, [S. 954](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/z?d113:S.954:), the Senate-passed version of the farm bill (the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013), would adopt a uniform definition of \"rural area\" for *all* USDA rural development programs, including the broadband program.  Under the Senate bill, a rural area would be defined as any area that is not a city or town with a population greater than 50,000, and that is not an urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or town with a population over 50,000.  Because the current definition of a rural area eligible for broadband loans is towns with populations under 20,000, this new definition would increase the number of larger communities eligible for broadband assistance. `\\[R42524__8___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Existing Providers\\n Because rural and sparsely populated areas typically offer providers less financial incentive to build broadband networks, it is generally the case that the more rural the area, the fewer the likely number of existing broadband providers.  By contrast, urban and suburban areas are more likely to have a greater number of existing broadband providers offering service.\\n One of the ongoing concerns expressed by some Members of Congress is the extent to which RUS grants and loans have been awarded to projects serving areas that already have existing providers offering broadband service.  [13] The issue of providing federal funding to areas and communities with existing providers is controversial, and has been previously raised with respect to the RUS Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program [14] and the Broadband Initiatives Program.  [15] Broadband awards to areas with preexisting service\u2014that is, areas where existing companies already provide some level of broadband\u2014have sparked controversy because award recipients might compete to some extent with other companies already providing broadband service.  On the one hand, one could argue that the federal government should not be subsidizing competitors for broadband service, particularly in sparsely populated rural markets which may be able only to support one provider.  Furthermore, providing grants and loans for projects serving communities with preexisting broadband service may divert assistance from unserved areas that are most in need.\\n On the other hand, many suburban and urban areas currently receive the benefits of competition among broadband providers\u2014competition which can potentially drive down prices while improving service and performance. It is therefore appropriate, others have argued, that rural areas also receive the benefits of competition, which in some areas may not be possible without federal financial assistance.  It is also argued that it may not be economically feasible for applicants to serve sparsely populated unserved communities unless they are permitted to also serve more lucrative areas which may already have existing providers.\\n The existing provider issue was examined during congressional consideration of the 2012 farm bill.  The 2008 farm bill (which is the current statute in force) set specific restrictions on the broadband loan eligibility of project areas with existing providers.  However, RUS did not issue a rule reflecting those changes until March 2011. Organizations representing the cable industry have argued that existing provider restrictions should be strengthened to focus the loan program more exclusively on unserved areas with no existing providers.  By contrast, organizations representing rural telecommunications providers (primarily the traditional rural telephone companies) counter that no changes should be made to the existing provider restrictions, given that RUS has had limited opportunity to award new loans under the new 2008 farm bill rules.  In the 2013 farm bill, [S. 954](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/z?d113:S.954:), as passed by the Senate, would change the existing provider restrictions currently in statute.  [16] In the House, a hearing held on April 25, 2012, by the House Subcommittee on Rural Development, Research, Biotechnology, and Foreign Agriculture, Committee on Agriculture, debated whether or not the rural broadband loan program should be modified to prohibit loans to projects serving areas with incumbent broadband service providers.

During the 20 \\\\[th\\\\] century, government and industry efforts to expand telephone service led to the development of a complex system of cross subsidies to expand the network and address universal service goals.  For example, profits from more densely populated, lower cost urbanized areas helped to subsidize wiring and operation costs for the less populous, higher cost rural areas.\\n With the advent of competition and the breakup of the Bell System, the complex system of cross subsidies that evolved to support universal service goals was no longer tenable.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ([P.L. 104-104](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d104:FLD002:@1(104+104)); 47 U.S.C., 1996 act) codified the long-standing commitment by U.S. policymakers to ensure universal service in the provision of telecommunications services (\u00a7254), and the FCC established a universal service fund (USF or Fund) to meet the objectives and principles contained in the act.  The 1996 act enumerated specific universal service principles including that \"access to advanced telecommunications and information services should be provided to all regions of the Nation\" (\u00a7254 \\\\[b\\\\] \\\\[2\\\\]) and \"consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas\" (\u00a7254 \\\\[b\\\\] \\\\[3\\\\]).  The concept of universal service was also expanded to include, among other principles, that elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, libraries, and rural health care providers have access to telecommunications services for specific purposes at discounted rates (\u00a7254\\\\[b\\\\]\\\\[6\\\\] and 254\\\\[h\\\\]).\\n One of the major policy debates surrounding universal service in the last decade was whether access to advanced telecommunications services (i.e., broadband) should be incorporated into universal service objectives.  With the growing importance and acceptance of broadband and Internet access, gaps in access to such services, particularly in rural areas, generated concern.  A growing number of policymakers felt that the USF should play a role in helping to alleviate this availability gap. They pointed to the provisions, cited above, contained in the Universal Service section of the 1996 act to support their position.  However, with the exception of funding for schools and libraries and rural health care providers, the USF was not designed to directly support broadband.\\n Provisions contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) called for the FCC to develop, and submit to Congress, a national broadband plan (NBP) to ensure that every American has \"access to broadband capability. \" [19] This plan, *Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan*, submitted to Congress on March 16, 2010, called for the USF to play a major role in achieving this goal. `\\[R42524__12___1\\]`"

The USF is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), an independent not-for-profit organization, under the direction of the FCC.  The FCC, through the USF, provides universal service support through a number of direct mechanisms that target both providers of and subscribers to telecommunications services. [20] The USF was designed to provide subsidies for voice telecommunications services for eligible high-cost (typically rural or insular) telecommunications carriers (High Cost Program) and economically needy individuals (Low Income Program); access for telecommunications services and broadband access for schools and libraries (Schools and Libraries Program); and access to telecommunications, advanced telecommunications, and information services for public and non-profit rural health care providers (Rural Health Care Program).  The USF disbursed \\\\$8.7 billion in 2012 with all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all territories receiving some benefit.  [21]\\n The FCC, in an October 2011 decision, adopted an order (USF Order, or Order) that calls for the USF to be transformed, in stages, over a multi-year period, from a mechanism to support voice telephone service to one that supports the deployment, adoption, and utilization of both fixed and mobile broadband.  More specifically, the High Cost Program is to be phased out and a new fund, the Connect America Fund (CAF), which includes the targeted Mobility Fund and new Remote Areas Fund, is to be created to replace it; and the Low Income, Schools and Libraries, and Rural Health Care programs are to be modified and given wider responsibilities.

Under the High Cost Program, eligible telecommunications carriers, usually those serving rural, insular, and other high-cost areas, are able to obtain funds to help offset the higher-than-average costs of providing telephone service.  This mechanism, which has always been the largest USF program based on disbursements, has been particularly important to rural America, where the lack of subscriber density leads to significantly higher costs.  The goal of the USF Order is to restructure and transition the High Cost Program from one that primarily supports voice communications to one that supports a broadband platform that enables multiple applications, including voice.  Although some carriers that received high-cost funding over the years have used high-cost funds to deploy broadband capable infrastructure, there was no requirement that recipients of high-cost funding provide any households in their service areas with broadband.\\n The Order requires that the High Cost Program be phased out and replaced in stages, to directly support high-capacity broadband networks (fixed and mobile) through a newly created Connect America Fund which includes the targeted components Mobility Fund and Remote Areas Fund.  The \"identical support rule\" is phased out.  For the first time universal service support provided to carriers serving high-cost areas (which is defined to include all current high-cost support mechanisms as well as the Connect America Fund) is subject to a budget; the budget is frozen at 2011 levels at \\\\$4.5 billion (plus administrative costs) per year for the next six years (2012-2017), subject to FCC review.

        "text": "### Connect America Fund\\n The Order created the Connect America Fund to support the provision of affordable voice and broadband services, both fixed and mobile, of at least 4 Mbps actual download speed and 1 Mbps actual upload speed.  The CAF will eventually replace all the existing support mechanisms in the High Cost Program for eligible carriers.  The path to this transition differs depending on whether a provider is a price cap carrier (i.e., a company whose interstate rates are subject to the price cap form of regulation) or a rate-of-return carrier (a company whose interstate rates are subject to rate-of-return regulation). [24]\\n *Price Cap Carriers*.  Price cap incumbent local exchange carriers, [25] which tend to be the large and mid-sized carriers, will transition to the CAF in two phases.  Under Phase I, which commenced on January 1, 2012, legacy high-cost funding is frozen at December 31, 2011, levels (estimated at no more than \\\\$ 1.8 billion annually) for price cap carriers and is required to be used to achieve universal availability of both voice and broadband.  Frozen high-cost support will equal the amount of support each carrier received in 2011 in a given study area (i.e., the defined geographic service area of an incumbent local exchange carrier\\\"s telephone operations).  An additional \\\\$300 million in \"incremental support\" to stimulate broadband deployment in unserved areas is also established.  This Phase I incremental support is available to those price-cap carriers that choose to deploy fixed broadband to areas not currently served, or targeted to be served, by a fixed broadband provider within their service territory. Access to Phase I incremental support is dependent on meeting specific criteria and build-out requirements, and is offered to jump-start the deployment of broadband to unserved areas within price-cap carrier service areas.  Any price-cap carrier electing to receive Phase I incremental support will receive \\\\$775 in incremental support for each unserved location it provides broadband with actual speeds of at least 4 Mbps actual download speed and 1 Mbps of actual upload speed. [26] Once the funds are accepted, carriers must meet deployment schedules to no fewer than two-thirds of the required locations within two years and complete all deployments within three years.  Of the \\\\$300 million made available for Phase I incremental support, only \\\\$115 million was taken with \\\\$185 million remaining unclaimed.  [27] A second round of Phase I support will be offered in 2013. [28] The FCC, in May 2013, released a Report and Order detailing the rules for the second round of Phase I incremental support.  [29] Provisions call for a disbursement of \\\\$485 million (\\\\$300 million plus the unclaimed \\\\$185 million from the previous round of incremental support) and expands eligibility to cover areas that are underserved as well as unserved.  [30] Support for unserved areas remains at \\\\$775 per location and support for underserved areas is set at \\\\$550 per location.  The FCC anticipates that this will be the last \"incremental support\" round before the transition to Phase II Price Cap annual support and any unused funds will be given to the Phase II Fund.\\n Under CAF Phase II Price Cap annual funds (estimated at no more than \\\\$1.8 billion annually) will be distributed through an FCC-developed cost model and through competitive bidding (e.g., reverse auctions) [31] for a period ending year-end 2017. CAF support will be available only in areas where a federal subsidy is needed to ensure the build-out and continued operation of broadband networks.  By the end of the third year, carriers that accept support must offer broadband speeds of at least 4 Mbps download speed and 1Mbps of upload speed.  In addition, usage capacity must be reasonably comparable to urban residential terrestrial fixed broadband to at least 85% of their high-cost locations and to all supported locations by the end of the fifth year (2017).  The incumbent carrier is given the right of first refusal, until the end-of- 2017, to receive the model-derived support, after which a shift to competitive bidding will be implemented. If an incumbent carrier declines Phase II funding the FCC will implement a competitive bidding process.  CAF Phase II price cap is not expected to be implemented until sometime in 2014.\\n *Rate-of-Return Carriers*.  Rate-of-return carriers, [32] which tend to be smaller carriers that solely provide service in rural areas, will continue to receive support, with some modifications, from current support mechanisms pending full transition to the CAF (through 2017).  During this transition, rate-of-return carriers\\\" legacy high-cost support is frozen at December 31, 2011, levels (estimated at no more than \\\\$2 billion annually).  Unlike in the case of price-cap carriers, no additional \"incremental support\" is provided specifically targeted for broadband deployment in unserved areas.  Modifications are made to the operations of the High Cost Program, as they impact rate-of-return carriers, during this transition period to improve \"the efficiency and effectiveness\" of USF support.  [33] For example, the Order phases out support over three years in study areas that overlap completely with an unsubsidized fixed, terrestrial broadband/voice competitor, and gradually phases down over three years (commencing July 1, 2012) per-line support to a cap of \\\\$250/per month (\\\\$3,000 annually).\\n Rate-of-return carriers that continue to receive legacy support or begin accepting CAF support are given more flexibility than price-cap carriers when deploying broadband.  Rate-of-return carriers are required to offer actual broadband service of at least 4 Mbps download speed and 1 Mbps of upload speed, with usage capacity reasonably comparable to urban residential terrestrial fixed broadband, **but only upon their customers\\\"** **reasonable request and within a reasonable amount of time**.  Furthermore, rate-of-return carriers are not, at this time, subject to specific build-out requirements or increased speed requirements and will not necessarily be required to build out and serve the most expensive locations within their service territories.  Many of the details and mechanics of how the transition of rate-of-return carriers from legacy high-cost support to the CAF have yet to be determined.  These details will be announced pending the completion of an extensive Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued as part of the USF Order.  [34] `\\[R42524__15___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Low Income Program\\n In the mid-1980s, FCC universal service policies were expanded to target low-income subscribers.  Two income-based programs, Lifeline and Link Up, were established to assist economically needy individuals.  The Link Up program, established in 1987, assists eligible low-income subscribers to pay the costs associated with the initiation of telephone service, and the Lifeline program, established in 1984, assists eligible low-income subscribers to pay the recurring monthly service charges incurred by telephone subscribers.  [38] Discounts are eligible for one connection, either wired or wireless, per household.  The expansion of the USF to directly target low-income individuals is of particular significance to those in rural areas. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the nonmetro poverty rate was 17.0 % in 2011 and has remained consistently higher than the metro poverty rate over time. [39]\\n An FCC-conducted broadband consumer survey found that 36% of non-adopters of broadband cited a financial reason as the main reason they do not have broadband service at home. [40] To address this barrier, the FCC adopted an order [41] on January 31, 2012, to modify the goals and operations of the Low Income Program.  The Link Up program is eliminated on non-Tribal Lands, but the role of the Lifeline Program is expanded to increase broadband adoption levels for low-income households; a \\\\$9.25 flat per-line monthly reimbursement rate is established on an interim basis; [42] and safeguards to combat waste, fraud, and abuse are also established. [43] Actions pertinent to broadband include those which modernize the Lifeline Program as a vehicle to ensure the availability of broadband for all low-income Americans.  This is to be achieved by allowing Lifeline support for bundled service plans that combine voice and broadband and establishing a Broadband Adoption Pilot Program to explore how to best use the Lifeline Program to increase broadband adoption among Lifeline eligible subscribers. [44] In a December 19, 2012, decision the FCC selected 14 projects to participate in the Lifeline pilot program.  The projects cover rural, suburban, and urban areas in 21 states and Puerto Rico.  The FCC authorized approximately \\\\$13.8 million in funding, which comes from savings resulting from Low Income Program reforms.  The Pilot Program will run for 18 months, beginning on February 1, 2013.  [45] `\\[R42524__20___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Schools and Libraries (E-Rate) Program\\n Under universal service provisions contained in the 1996 act, elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, and libraries, are designated as beneficiaries of universal service discounts.  Universal service principles detailed in Section 254(b)(6) state that \"Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms ... and libraries should have access to advanced telecommunications services. \" The act further requires in Section 254(h)(1)(B) that services within the definition of universal service be provided to elementary and secondary schools and libraries for education purposes at discounts, that is at \"rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties. \"\\n The FCC established the Schools and Libraries Division within the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) to administer the schools and libraries or \"E (education)-Rate\" program to comply with these provisions.  The E-Rate Program supports connectivity, and funding is available under four categories of services: telecommunications and dedicated services; internal connections (e.g., wiring, routers, and servers); Internet access; and basic maintenance of internal connections, with the first category receiving funding priority.  The applicant is responsible for providing additional resources such as end-user equipment (e.g., computers, telephones), software, and training.  Under this program, which became effective January 1, 1998, eligible schools and libraries receive discounts ranging from 20% to 90% for eligible services depending on the poverty level of the school\\\"s (or school district\\\"s) population and its location in a high-cost telecommunications area (urban/rural status). [46] Eligible schools, school districts, and libraries may apply on an individual or a consortium basis.  The FCC established a yearly ceiling, or cap, of \\\\$2.25 billion, adjusted for inflation prospectively, beginning with funding year 2010, for this program.  [47] Since its inception this program has been over-subscribed, leaving requests by otherwise qualified applicants unfulfilled.\\n Areas that do not have ready access to broadband are likely to depend on anchor institutions, such as schools and libraries, to meet growing broadband needs.  The FCC has acknowledged the importance of anchor institutions in achieving broadband access goals, and has taken steps to upgrade the E-Rate Program by, among other actions, permitting schools to allow community use of E-Rate funded services outside of school hours; supporting eligible services to the residential portion of schools that serve students in special circumstances (e.g., schools on tribal lands); and committing \\\\$9 million to a pilot program, \"Learning On-The-Go,\" to support off-campus connectivity in 20 schools and libraries, for K-12 students and library patrons, for portable (wireless) learning devices outside of regular school or library hours.

Subsection 254(h)(1) further specifies that \"to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable,\" health care providers should have access to advanced telecommunications and information services.  The FCC established the Rural Health Care Division (RHCD) within the USAC to administer the universal support program to comply with these provisions.\\n Under FCC-established rules only public or non-profit health care providers are eligible to receive funding.  Eligible health care providers, with the exception of those requesting only access to the Internet, must also be located in a rural area. [49] Like the Schools and Libraries program, this support program went into effect on January 1, 1998, and a funding ceiling, or cap, was established, in this case at \\\\$400 million annually.  The primary use of the funding is to provide reduced rates for telecommunications and information services (e.g., transmission of data, images, or interactive video) necessary for the provision of health care to either qualified individual health care providers or consortia. Health care providers can use funding to save on service they already have, to upgrade current services, or to install new services.  Equipment charges are not eligible for support.  The telecommunications program was established in 1997 to ensure that rural health care providers pay no more than their urban counterparts for their telecommunications needs when providing health care services.  The Internet access program, which was established in 2003, provides a 50% discount on the cost of monthly Internet access in states that are entirely rural [50] and a 25% discount for all other rural health care providers.  Only the monthly charge for access is eligible for support.  These two programs are collectively known as the \"Primary Program.\" [51]\\n The FCC, in 2007, established a \"Rural Health Care Pilot Program\" to help public and non-profit health care providers build state- and region-wide broadband networks dedicated to the provision of health care services.  The Pilot Program funds up to 85% of the eligible costs of broadband infrastructure deployment of telehealth networks that connect rural and urban health care providers within a state or region.  The Pilot is closed to new projects and participants will transition to the newly created Healthcare Connect Fund.\\n The Healthcare Connect Fund, which was created by the FCC in a December 12, 2012, order, was established to expand access to broadband, particularly in rural areas, for eligible public or not-for-profit health care providers.  [52] The Healthcare Connect Fund, will absorb the Internet Access Program (which is currently part of the Primary Program), and replace the Rural Health Care Pilot Program with a permanent program.  The Healthcare Connect Fund will encourage consortia between smaller rural health care providers and urban medical centers, but consortia must remain majority rural.  The Fund will provide a 65% discount on broadband services, equipment, and connections with health care providers required to contribute the balance (35%).  Upfront payments for the Healthcare Connect Fund is \\\\$150 million annually.  It is anticipated that the FCC will begin accepting applications in late summer 2013.\\n The FCC also established, as part of the Healthcare Connect Fund, a Skilled Nursing Facilities Pilot Program to assess how to support broadband connections for skilled nursing facilities.  The pilot, which is scheduled for a 2014 implementation, will give preference to facilities in rural areas and will receive funding of up to \\\\$50 million total over a three-year period.

The decision by the FCC to incorporate broadband and mobility mandates into the universal service concept, and the subsequent restructuring of the USF to accommodate this decision, will have a major impact on consumers and providers of telecommunications and broadband services.  As the United States moves towards this transition, numerous policy issues and concerns have surfaced.  Included among the issues confronting policy makers are how to define success; who should pay to support this mandate; how the nation should address the rural/rural divide; and how the nation should ensure that these changes do not negatively impact the financial health of, in particular, small, rural carriers that are significantly dependent on USF subsidies.\\n\\n\\n Table 2.

        "text": "## Who Should Pay?\\n The 1996 act requires that every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services be responsible for universal service support (\u00a7254\\\\[d\\\\]) and that such charges be made explicit (\u00a7254\\\\[e\\\\]).  [56] Therefore, the USF receives no federal monies but is funded by mandatory contributions from telecommunications carriers providing interstate service.  [57] These contributions are based on a percentage of the interstate and international telecommunications end-user revenues of telecommunications carriers and are called the contribution factor.  This contribution factor has grown significantly since its inception from approximately 5.5% in 1998 to an all-time high of 17.9% in the first quarter of 2012; the factor for the first quarter of 2013 is 16.1 %.  [58] Increases in demand for, and expansion of services covered by, the USF, as well as technological change and decreases in the interstate and international revenue base, have all contributed to this upward trend.\\n The FCC\"s decision to include broadband and mobility in the universal service definition has further highlighted the need to address how the funding mechanism should be modified to support such a mandate.  At issue is the uncertainty and costs associated with mandating nationwide deployment of broadband as a universal service policy goal, and the impact that such a mandate will have on an already strained funding mechanism.  Some have expressed concern that given the pressures currently facing the USF, and their impact on the contribution factor, a restructuring of the funding mechanism should have been addressed prior to, or at least simultaneously with, the expansion of the USF definition.  Questions regarding who should contribute, how the mechanism to assess such contributions should be designed, and whether the contribution base should be expanded, are among the issues to be considered.  The FCC, on April 27, 2012, adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on comprehensive reforms to address the USF funding issue.  [59] `\\[R42524__25___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Rural-Rural Divide\\n Rural America is subject to a \"rural-rural divide\" when it comes to the presence of broadband infrastructure.  Some parts of rural America have sophisticated high-level broadband access while other parts have little to no broadband access.  Disparity in access to broadband among rural areas is known as the \"rural-rural divide.\"  Price-cap companies, which are largely classified as non-rural carriers, serve both urban and rural areas and in their rural service areas face issues, such as remoteness and lack of density resulting in high costs, more commonly associated with rural carriers.  According to the FCC, more than 83% of the approximately 18 million Americans that lack access to residential fixed broadband at or above the FCC\\\"s broadband speed benchmark live in areas served by price-cap carriers.  [60] In other rural areas, often served by rate-of-return carriers, broadband is being deployed, often with the support of a combination of RUS loans and USF support.  To address this disparity the FCC, in its USF Order, established a \\\\$300 million incremental support component in the Phase I CAF Fund for areas lacking broadband infrastructure, solely for the use of price-cap carriers.\\n Concern has been expressed that providing for a CAF Phase I Fund for broadband deployment, solely for the use of price-cap carriers, disadvantages rural areas lacking broadband infrastructure that are served by the smaller, rural rate-of-return carriers.  Some question why access to such funding should be limited to price-cap carriers when other areas of the nation are facing the same, or even more challenging, conditions to bring broadband to areas lacking access.  If the ultimate goal is to bring broadband to all unserved areas, they ask, why should this funding be based on carrier classification rather than need?  They also point to the fact that \\\\$185 million of the \\\\$300 million total for 2012 went unclaimed to further support their position that this support should be opened to all providers. `\\[R42524__26___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Financial Health of Rate-of-Return Carriers\\n Smaller, rural, rate-of-return carriers are particularly dependent on USF subsidies, [61] and have expressed concern that the reforms that the USF Order will implement could place them under financial hardship.  Many RUS telecommunications and broadband borrowers (loan recipients) receive high cost USF subsidies.  In many cases, the subsidy received from USF helps provide the revenue necessary to keep the loan viable.  The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan program is highly dependent on high-cost USF revenues, with 99% (476 out of 480 borrowers) receiving interstate high-cost USF support.  This is not surprising, given that the RUS Telecommunications Loans are available only to the most rural and high-cost areas (towns with populations less than 5,000).  Regarding broadband loans, 60% of BIP (stimulus) borrowers draw from state or interstate USF support mechanisms, while 10% of farm bill (Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program) broadband borrowers receive interstate high-cost USF support.  [62] Thus, to the extent that USF may be reformed, this could have an impact on the viability of RUS telecommunications and broadband loans, and ultimately the overall financial health of the carrier.\\n Although the FCC included a waiver process in its USF Order for those carriers that felt they would be subject to significant economic stress, due to the reforms, many smaller carriers assert that the waiver process is too burdensome and difficult and that the requirements for qualifying for relief are too restrictive. `\\[R42524__27___1\\]`"

        "text": "## RUS and USF: Different Approaches, Shared Goals\\n The RUS broadband programs and the FCC\"s Universal Service Fund (USF) share a common goal: increasing broadband infrastructure deployment and applications in rural areas.  [63] However, the way that each program addresses these goals is markedly different.\\n \\n- RUS grants and loans are used as up-front capital to invest in\\n   broadband infrastructure, whereas the USF provides ongoing subsidies to keep the operation of telecommunications\u2014and most recently broadband networks in high-cost areas\u2014economically viable for providers.  These subsidies, in turn, enable providers to invest in upgrading their telephone networks to make them broadband-capable. \\n- Aside from the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) program, RUS\\n   telecommunications programs address broadband infrastructure deployment, which is intended to increase the availability of broadband in rural America.  The USF, while also addressing broadband availability (through the High Cost Program and the Connect America Fund), also addresses end-user broadband adoption through the Low Income Program. \\n- Regarding the health and education applications, the principal\\n   difference between RUS programs (Distance Learning and Telemedicine) and the USF programs (Schools and Libraries Program, Rural Health Care Program) is that RUS funds end-user equipment, while USF funds connectivity.  DLT grants serve as initial capital assets for equipment, instructional programming, technical assistance, or instruction for using eligible equipment (e.g., video conferencing equipment, computers) that operate via telecommunications to rural end-users of telemedicine and distance learning.  DLT does not fund the telecommunications that connects that equipment.  By contrast, the USF Schools and Libraries Program supports the conduit or pipeline for communications using telecommunications services and/or the Internet, and includes four categories of service: telecommunications services, Internet access, internal connections, and basic maintenance of internal connections.  Similarly, the Rural Health Care Program provides discounts for rural non-profit health care providers by providing connectivity. \\n- Finally, the RUS programs are funded through annual appropriations and\\n   are subject to the annual congressional budget process.  By contrast, USF is *not* funded through annual appropriations, but is funded by mandatory contributions from telecommunications carriers that provide interstate service. `\\[R42524__28___1\\]`"

With the September 30, 2010, conclusion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ([P.L. 111-5](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d111:FLD002:@1(111+5))) broadband grant and loan awards, the RUS broadband programs and the USF programs remain the only ongoing federal vehicles to provide financial assistance for rural broadband deployment.\\n With both programs currently at a pivotal point, an issue for the 113 \\\\[th\\\\] Congress is how best to shape those programs as they go forward. The statute authorizing the Rural Broadband Loan and Loan Guarantee\u2014Section 601 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936\u2014was significantly modified in the 2008 farm bill, and is being addressed once more in the 2013 farm bill.  [64] Typically a new farm bill is developed every five years, principally by the House Committee on Agriculture and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.  The Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate both have a major role to play as well, as each considers annual appropriations for the RUS broadband programs through the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.\\n Meanwhile, the USF is undergoing a major and unprecedented transition through a series of reforms being implemented by the FCC.  Congress has largely adopted an oversight role and a \"wait and see\" posture with respect to the FCC\\\"s USF reforms.  [65] While numerous Members have written letters to the FCC urging various modifications in the reform package, there was no comprehensive legislation introduced into the 112 \\\\[th\\\\] Congress that addressed the FCC\\\"s USF reforms.  The House Energy and Commerce Committee, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the House Committee on Natural Resources continue to assess the impact of the reforms, and the FCC\\\"s progress in their implementation.  To the extent that various constituencies and interest groups (whether it be small rate-of-return carriers, large price-cap carriers, competitive providers, state utility regulators, or broadband providers and consumers) feel they are disadvantaged by the reforms, and to the extent that programmatic inefficiencies or waste, fraud, and abuse come to light (as they have in the past through GAO reports, for example), Congress always has the prerogative in the future of formulating and considering legislation that could modify those reforms by amending the 1934 Communications Act. [66]\\n Given that the RUS and USF broadband programs share the goal of deploying broadband to rural America, Congress may also wish to assess how these two programs can best fit together.  Are they effectively targeted towards providing broadband to the most unserved areas of the nation, while at the same time minimizing adverse impacts on private incumbent providers?  Are they the most cost-effective way for Congress to fund rural broadband development?  To what extent are the two programs complementary and to what extent do the two programs overlap?  And finally, how will changes made to the USF program affect the viability of broadband loans made under the RUS programs? `\\[R42524__29___1\\]`"

    "summary": "As of 2019, over 20 million Americans\u2014predominantly those living in rural areas\u2014lacked access to high speed broadband service according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Federal subsidies underwritten by taxpayer funds and long-distance telephone subscriber fees have injected billions of dollars into rural broadband markets over the past decade\u2014mostly on the supply side in the form of grants, loans, and direct support to broadband providers. \nYet, adoption rates have leveled off after more than a decade of rapid growth, even as broadband providers have extended service to remote and hard-to-serve areas. The overall share of U.S. adults using the internet has not grown significantly since 2013, according to the Pew Research Center\u2014a trend reflected in rural broadband subscription rates, which continue to lag significantly behind rates in urban areas.\nObservers note that weak demand in nascent broadband markets makes it more difficult for federal agencies to elicit private-sector program participation and investment in high-cost, high-risk rural areas. Even in subsidized markets, broadband infrastructure buildout ultimately rests on business decisions made in the private sector. On average, rural areas are less wealthy than urbanized areas, and have older populations with lower educational attainment\u2014factors which negatively correlate with demand for broadband service. Related barriers to adoption, such as lower perceived value, affordability, computer ownership, and computer literacy, have persisted over many years.\nMarkets tend to be highly localized. Those with favorable geography and demographic profiles often have higher demand, and thus present relatively attractive investment opportunities, for broadband providers. However, the federal government has found it difficult to incentivize sustained private-sector investment in more isolated and sparsely populated locales where it is clear that new or upgraded service will be costly to provide, and may fail to attract a large number of new paying subscribers.\nOverall, current federal spending on affordability and adoption programs amounts to less than one-quarter of total spending for rural broadband expansion. The FCC\u2019s Lifeline program reduces monthly subscription costs for qualifying low-income households, but enrollment rates are comparatively low. No major federal programs currently support consumer outreach and education, although certain federal grants may use funds for related activities. Other programs to support broadband buildout to schools, clinics, and other community institutions have improved access for residents of rural areas, but it is not clear that these programs have affected overall market demand.\nBroadband advocates frequently identify broadband enabled services like telemedicine and precision agriculture as potential demand drivers. However, lower rates of health insurance coverage in rural areas and certain state regulations limiting Medicaid reimbursement for telemedicine services may depress demand growth and private sector investment in broadband. Likewise, high up-front costs and unfamiliarity have hindered adoption of precision agriculture technology by small producers in isolated rural areas.\nFederal broadband programs have generally been agnostic to the demand side of rural broadband markets, based on the implicit assumption that demand for broadband service will quickly emerge as broadband providers extend new or upgraded service to these locales. Program rules typically require broadband providers to extend service availability to a certain area within a certain timeframe, but they generally do not require them to achieve specific market development goals for adoption and usage. The FCC has expressed concern that some subsidized providers may lack incentive to develop markets in their service areas. \nOptions for congressional consideration include measures to address obstacles to adoption and additional incentives for private sector investment in the rural broadband sector. These may include expansion of end-user subsidies, both within the broadband sector and other sectors that utilize broadband-enabled technologies. Congress may also consider measures to encourage broadband providers to increase investment in persistently underserved rural areas and more aggressively develop nascent broadband markets. These may include adjustment to subsidy rates and program rules, including introduction of adoption milestones for subsidy recipients. Additionally, Congress may consider measures to increase education and outreach.",

Federal subsidies underwritten by taxpayer funds and long-distance telephone subscriber fees have injected billions of dollars into rural broadband markets over the past decade\u2014mostly on the supply side in the form of grants, loans, and direct support to broadband providers.\n Yet, adoption rates have leveled off after more than a decade of rapid growth, even as broadband providers have extended service to remote and hard-to-serve areas.  The overall share of U.S. adults using the internet has not grown significantly since 2013, according to the Pew Research Center\u2014a trend reflected in rural broadband subscription rates, which continue to lag significantly behind rates in urban areas.\n Observers note that weak demand in nascent broadband markets makes it more difficult for federal agencies to elicit private-sector program participation and investment in high-cost, high-risk rural areas.  Even in subsidized markets, broadband infrastructure buildout ultimately rests on business decisions made in the private sector.  On average, rural areas are less wealthy than urbanized areas, and have older populations with lower educational attainment\u2014factors which negatively correlate with demand for broadband service.  Related barriers to adoption, such as lower perceived value, affordability, computer ownership, and computer literacy, have persisted over many years.\n Markets tend to be highly localized.  Those with favorable geography and demographic profiles often have higher demand, and thus present relatively attractive investment opportunities, for broadband providers. However, the federal government has found it difficult to incentivize sustained private-sector investment in more isolated and sparsely populated locales where it is clear that new or upgraded service will be costly to provide, and may fail to attract a large number of new paying subscribers.\n Overall, current federal spending on affordability and adoption programs amounts to less than one-quarter of total spending for rural broadband expansion.  The FCC's Lifeline program reduces monthly subscription costs for qualifying low-income households, but enrollment rates are comparatively low.  No major federal programs currently support consumer outreach and education, although certain federal grants may use funds for related activities.  Other programs to support broadband buildout to schools, clinics, and other community institutions have improved access for residents of rural areas, but it is not clear that these programs have affected overall market demand.\n Broadband advocates frequently identify broadband enabled services like telemedicine and precision agriculture as potential demand drivers. However, lower rates of health insurance coverage in rural areas and certain state regulations limiting Medicaid reimbursement for telemedicine services may depress demand growth and private sector investment in broadband.  Likewise, high up-front costs and unfamiliarity have hindered adoption of precision agriculture technology by small producers in isolated rural areas.\n Federal broadband programs have generally been agnostic to the demand side of rural broadband markets, based on the implicit assumption that demand for broadband service will quickly emerge as broadband providers extend new or upgraded service to these locales.  Program rules typically require broadband providers to extend service availability to a certain area within a certain timeframe, but they generally do not require them to achieve specific market development goals for adoption and usage.  The FCC has expressed concern that some subsidized providers may lack incentive to develop markets in their service areas.\n Options for congressional consideration include measures to address obstacles to adoption and additional incentives for private sector investment in the rural broadband sector.  These may include expansion of end-user subsidies, both within the broadband sector and other sectors that utilize broadband-enabled technologies.  Congress may also consider measures to encourage broadband providers to increase investment in persistently underserved rural areas and more aggressively develop nascent broadband markets.  These may include adjustment to subsidy rates and program rules, including introduction of adoption milestones for subsidy recipients.  Additionally, Congress may consider measures to increase education and outreach.\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------ (R46108(4))",

Federal subsidies underwritten by taxpayer funds and long-distance telephone subscriber fees have injected billions of dollars into rural broadband markets over the past decade\u2014mostly on the supply side in the form of grants, loans, and direct support to broadband providers.\\n Yet, adoption rates have leveled off after more than a decade of rapid growth, even as broadband providers have extended service to remote and hard-to-serve areas.  The overall share of U.S. adults using the internet has not grown significantly since 2013, according to the Pew Research Center\u2014a trend reflected in rural broadband subscription rates, which continue to lag significantly behind rates in urban areas.\\n Observers note that weak demand in nascent broadband markets makes it more difficult for federal agencies to elicit private-sector program participation and investment in high-cost, high-risk rural areas.  Even in subsidized markets, broadband infrastructure buildout ultimately rests on business decisions made in the private sector.  On average, rural areas are less wealthy than urbanized areas, and have older populations with lower educational attainment\u2014factors which negatively correlate with demand for broadband service.  Related barriers to adoption, such as lower perceived value, affordability, computer ownership, and computer literacy, have persisted over many years.\\n Markets tend to be highly localized.  Those with favorable geography and demographic profiles often have higher demand, and thus present relatively attractive investment opportunities, for broadband providers. However, the federal government has found it difficult to incentivize sustained private-sector investment in more isolated and sparsely populated locales where it is clear that new or upgraded service will be costly to provide, and may fail to attract a large number of new paying subscribers.\\n Overall, current federal spending on affordability and adoption programs amounts to less than one-quarter of total spending for rural broadband expansion.  The FCC\"s Lifeline program reduces monthly subscription costs for qualifying low-income households, but enrollment rates are comparatively low.  No major federal programs currently support consumer outreach and education, although certain federal grants may use funds for related activities.  Other programs to support broadband buildout to schools, clinics, and other community institutions have improved access for residents of rural areas, but it is not clear that these programs have affected overall market demand.\\n Broadband advocates frequently identify broadband enabled services like telemedicine and precision agriculture as potential demand drivers. However, lower rates of health insurance coverage in rural areas and certain state regulations limiting Medicaid reimbursement for telemedicine services may depress demand growth and private sector investment in broadband.  Likewise, high up-front costs and unfamiliarity have hindered adoption of precision agriculture technology by small producers in isolated rural areas.\\n Federal broadband programs have generally been agnostic to the demand side of rural broadband markets, based on the implicit assumption that demand for broadband service will quickly emerge as broadband providers extend new or upgraded service to these locales.  Program rules typically require broadband providers to extend service availability to a certain area within a certain timeframe, but they generally do not require them to achieve specific market development goals for adoption and usage.  The FCC has expressed concern that some subsidized providers may lack incentive to develop markets in their service areas.\\n Options for congressional consideration include measures to address obstacles to adoption and additional incentives for private sector investment in the rural broadband sector.  These may include expansion of end-user subsidies, both within the broadband sector and other sectors that utilize broadband-enabled technologies.  Congress may also consider measures to encourage broadband providers to increase investment in persistently underserved rural areas and more aggressively develop nascent broadband markets.  These may include adjustment to subsidy rates and program rules, including introduction of adoption milestones for subsidy recipients.  Additionally, Congress may consider measures to increase education and outreach.\\n \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ `\\[R46108__4___1\\]`"

        "text": "## Introduction\\n Congress has a long-standing interest in ensuring access to broadband internet service in rural areas.  Federal subsidies underwritten by taxes and long-distance telephone subscriber fees have injected billions of dollars into rural broadband markets over a period of decades\u2014mostly on the supply side\u2014in the form of grants, loans, and direct support to broadband providers.  [1] As of 2019, more than 20 million Americans still lacked broadband access. [2]\\n According to many stakeholders and policy experts, federal spending on broadband expansion has not adequately accounted for local conditions in rural areas that depress effective demand for broadband.  Lower demand in rural areas may discourage private-sector investment and reduce the effectiveness of federal efforts to expand and improve broadband service.\\n According to the authors of a 2015 study on rural broadband expansion, \"While the vast majority of federal programs dealing with broadband have focused on the provision of infrastructure, many economists and others involved in the debate have argued that the emphasis should instead be on increasing demand in the areas that are lagging behind. \" [3] The study found that rural households\\\" broadband adoption rate lagged that of urban households by 12-13 percentage points and that while 38% of the rural-urban \"broadband gap\" in 2011 was attributable to lack of necessary infrastructure, 52% was attributable to lower adoption rates.\\n \"Implicit in many supply-side arguments is an assumption that demand-side issues will resolve themselves once there is ample supply of cheap and ultra-fast broadband,\" wrote the directors of the Advanced Communications Law & Policy Institute (ACLP) in a public comment to the Commerce Department\\\"s Broadband Opportunity Council in 2015.  \"Though appealing, this reductive cause\u2010and\u2010effect has been questioned by social scientists, researchers, practitioners, and others who have worked to identify and better understand the complex mechanics associated with broadband adoption across key demographics and in key sectors. \" [4]\\n The geographic and demographic distribution of rural broadband demand is uneven.  There is unmet demand in some rural areas.  In others, even where there is access, that may not translate into widespread adoption. Observers cite a range of factors.  On average, rural areas are less wealthy than urbanized areas, and have older populations with lower educational attainment\u2014factors which negatively correlate with demand for broadband service.  Related barriers to adoption, such as lower perceived value, affordability, computer ownership, and computer literacy, have persisted over many years.  Rural areas with relatively favorable geography and demographics may attract significant investment in broadband service, but even subsidies may fail to spur buildout in less-attractive rural markets.\\n This report complements separate CRS analyses of major federal subsidy programs on the supply side of the market by providing an analysis of demand-side issues at the nexus of infrastructure buildout and adoption. [5] It focuses exclusively on demand for fixed broadband among rural households and small businesses.  It does not address the role of schools, healthcare facilities, public libraries, and other \"community anchor institutions\" as end users of broadband. However, it does include discussion of the role schools and libraries play as providers of broadband service and training to rural residents who may lack home access to the internet, and how this may affect overall household adoption behavior.  It also includes discussion of broadband-enabled services, such as telemedicine and precision agriculture, which may incentivize more rural households and small businesses to adopt broadband service.\\n The report begins with a discussion of the rural broadband market\u2014specifically, the characteristics of demand in rural households and small businesses, and how these affect private-sector infrastructure investments.  It then provides a survey of federal broadband programs and policies designed to spur broadband buildout and adoption, with a discussion of how demand-side issues may impede achievement of these goals.

        "text": "## The Rural Broadband Market\\n According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 60 million Americans, or 19.3% of the total population, live in rural areas, defined as \"all population, housing, and territory not included within an urbanized area or urban cluster. \" As of 2010, urbanized areas and urban clusters occupied about 3% of the U.S. land mass, yet contained more than 80% of the U.S. population.  [6] As a result, fixed broadband network infrastructure, which largely relies on wireline connections to the physical addresses of subscribers, is geographically concentrated.\\n Urban areas have benefited from this concentration, especially areas with favorable geographic locations and economic conditions.  For example, the City of Huntington Beach, CA, charges broadband providers rent for access to its utility poles\u2014\\\\$2,000 per pole per year\u2014and leases access to city-owned fiber-optic cable (fiber) infrastructure. \"We continue to have a lot of carriers wanting to site on our poles in our downtown area which is next to the beach,\" a city official said during a 2019 webinar, noting that other, less favorably located cities had not been able to duplicate Huntington Beach\\\"s development model. \"\\\\[An\\\\] inland city is not going to get what we get here on the coast. \" [7]\\n In contrast, in many rural areas, the cost of providing broadband service may approach\u2014or even exceed\u2014the predicted return on investment. Broadband providers may not be willing to serve these areas without support from direct government subsidies, grants, or loans.  Local conditions in rural areas vary widely, though.  Some rural markets may be relatively attractive on commercial terms, because of unique characteristics such as the presence of post-secondary educational institutions or tourism attractions, relatively high levels of economic development and educational attainment, favorable demographics, or proximity to urban areas.  Other rural markets that lack these characteristics are likely to be less commercially attractive.\\n Long-term demographic trends suggest a growing bifurcation of the rural broadband market.  According to a 2018 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) analysis, rural areas have witnessed \"declining unemployment, rising incomes, and declining poverty,\" as well as more favorable net migration rates since 2013.  However, the analysis also found that \"people moving to rural areas tend to persistently favor more densely settled rural areas with attractive scenic qualities, or those near large cities.  Fewer are moving to sparsely settled, less scenic, and more remote locations, which compounds economic development challenges in those areas. \" [8]\\n For reasons that will be explained in more detail below, household and small business demand for broadband service is likely to be impacted in rural areas by demographic trends, geography, and economic context.  As a result, these factors affect the infrastructure investment behavior of broadband providers, raising policy questions about the appropriate level of federal assistance and how it can be distributed most effectively and efficiently.\\n The next three sections of this report discuss the adoption of broadband service by rural households and rural small businesses and the implications of market demand for private-sector investment in rural broadband infrastructure. `\\[R46108__6___1\\]`"

        "text": "### Valuation of Broadband Service by Rural Households\\n Adoption rates for broadband service are highly dependent on the valuation that households and small businesses place on internet access. Studies suggest that on average, valuation of internet access\u2014measured as willingness to pay for broadband service\u2014is lower for rural households than for urban households.  Knowledge of computers, computer ownership, and perceived relevance of the internet\u2014all of which affect consumer valuation\u2014tend to be lower among older, less educated, and less wealthy households.  Because rural households tend to be older, less educated, and less wealthy than their urban counterparts, their willingness to pay for broadband also tends to be lower. [9]\\n Not all households are the same, of course.  A substantial number of low-income households do not subscribe to broadband service even when it is offered to them at no cost, indicating a valuation of zero.  At the same time, many reports indicate that some rural residents are willing go to extensive lengths to access the internet for tasks they view as essential, even if broadband service is not available at their home or business.  The relatively lower proportion of potential subscribers in rural areas who are both highly motivated to adopt broadband and are able to pay for it complicates the business case.\\n\\n\\n A 2010 study, based on a report commissioned by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), found that survey respondents were, on average, willing to pay an extra \\\\$45 per month for \"fast\" speeds adequate for music, photo sharing, and videos.  However, on average, respondents were only willing to pay an extra \\\\$48\u2014a difference of \\\\$3\u2014for \"very fast\" speeds adequate for gaming, large file transfers, and high-definition movies.  [11] Households that already had relatively high speed broadband were generally willing to pay more than average for very fast service.\\n While consumer expectations have certainly evolved over the past decade, the 2010 study\\\"s findings are broadly consistent with those of subsequent studies: most consumers, regardless of where they reside, value basic internet access at speeds adequate for everyday use, but only a relative few are willing to pay substantially more for very high speeds.  Members of the latter group generally have higher levels of broadband connectivity than others, and belong to relatively wealthier, better-educated demographic groups.\\n The FCC sponsored a series of field experiments, beginning in 2012, to gain better understanding of broadband demand among low-income households.  The goal of these experiments was to inform administration of the federal Lifeline program, which subsidizes voice and broadband service charges for qualifying low-income consumers.\\n A 2015 report on a field experiment conducted in West Virginia and eastern Ohio found that Lifeline-eligible non-subscribers in that region were overwhelmingly willing to pay \\\\$3 more per month to move from bottom-tier speeds (1 megabits-per-second (Mbps), offered at \\\\$31.99 per month) to moderate broadband speeds (6 Mbps, offered at \\\\$34.99 per month).  However, only one out of 118 participants was willing to pay \\\\$44.99 per month\u2014an extra \\\\$10\u2014to double their maximum download speed from 6 to 12 Mbps.  [12]\\n The Lifeline program itself has long been undersubscribed, despite the fact that it frequently reduces consumer out-of-pocket costs to zero (see text box above, \"Why Is the Lifeline Program Undersubscribed?\").\\n A 2014 study, based on a survey funded by the Department of Commerce of 15,000 non-adopting households at all income levels, found that approximately two-thirds of respondents would not consider adopting broadband at any price, and that non-adopters were disproportionately rural (36% of non-adopters lived in rural areas, as compared to 19.3% of all Americans).  [13] The remaining one-third of respondents voiced interest in broadband adoption.  Rural respondents were more likely to belong to this group than their urban counterparts, despite making up a disproportionately large share of non-adopters overall.  These respondents most commonly identified price and availability as the main barriers to adoption.  The study authors estimated that achieving a 10% increase in subscribership among members of the group who reported price as a factor in their decision would require an average price decrease of 15%. [14]\\n A 2012 study of broadband usage among Kentucky farmers broadly tracks with other studies that show a higher propensity for broadband adoption among younger, better educated, higher earning, business-oriented households with experience using the internet, regardless of location. The study found that a representative 45-year-old producer earning more than \\\\$50,000 on a 750 acre farm, who had experience using the internet but did not have broadband access, was willing to pay \\\\$171.42 as a hypothetical one-time property tax payment to support buildout of the necessary local infrastructure to provide broadband access to area farms.  [15] On the other end of the spectrum, a representative 63-year-old producer with a 250 acre farm earning less than \\\\$50,000, who had not subscribed to broadband service even when it was available, was willing to pay a one-time payment of just 20 cents to support broadband infrastructure improvements.  The average age of survey respondents was 59.2 years.\\n The Kentucky Department of Agriculture reported in 2019 that the demographic profile of Kentucky farmers is shifting, including a larger number of younger producers.  [16] This demographic shift may lead to increased demand for broadband service expansion and improvements in the rural areas of Kentucky where it is most pronounced.  Given that demographic trends vary at the local level, though, they will likely not affect broadband market development equally in all parts of the state. `\\[R46108__7___1\\]`"

        "text": "### Valuation of Broadband Service by Rural Small Businesses\\n Small businesses are generally more likely than residential households to regard broadband internet access as essential.  However, within the small business sector there are significant differences in willingness to pay for any given level of service.  Businesses with relatively modest data requirements may elect not to upgrade to a higher tier of service if the expected productivity benefits are less than the expected subscription and equipment upgrade costs. [17]\\n A 2010 study sponsored by the Small Business Administration (SBA), in fulfilment of requirements of the Broadband Data Improvement Act ([P.L. 110-385](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d110:FLD002:@1(110+385))), found that \"broadband is central to U.S. small businesses in ways that it is not to individuals.  The small business broadband adoption rate has increased to 90% as of the date of this survey (April 2010), compared to 74% of adults with broadband access in their homes....  \" [18] Surveys conducted for the SBA study showed that both rural and urban respondents viewed high-speed internet \"as an essential service\" that enabled them to \"achieve strategic goals, improve competitiveness and efficiency, reach customers, and interact with vendors. \" [19] However, the study found that non-agricultural rural businesses were significantly less likely to have their own website than their urban counterparts were.  Likewise, they were less likely to be willing to pay substantially more for improved service, even though the study found that they rated the quality of service in rural areas lower than respondents in urban areas did.  Most rural businesses surveyed indicated that they were not willing to pay 10% more for significantly improved service. [20]\\n Studies that are more recent have made similar findings.  Although basic access to the internet in rural areas is much more widespread than it was a decade ago, usage practices of many small businesses do not appear to have changed significantly.  Most appear to value basic internet access to support a few essential low-bandwidth functions, such as making the name and location of the business available on internet searches, but proportionately fewer appear to demand high-bandwidth advanced business applications.\\n For example, a 2017 study comparing selected rural and urban areas of North Carolina found that many small rural businesses have no web presence beyond a listing in Google search results, and that more than half of those businesses that did have a web page used it solely to provide basic information about the business. [21] \"Overall, small rural businesses are not using internet-based technology to support their businesses. While they may have broadband access, their use of websites, e-commerce and social media is limited, and it is significantly lower than small urban businesses,\" the study authors wrote. [22] Apparently, small businesses find internet access useful, but many do not use applications requiring high bandwidth.\\n It is not clear from these results what immediate benefits would be provided to non-intensive business users in remote rural areas by improvements in broadband service speed and quality.  However, broadband advocacy groups have suggested that emerging new applications and encouraging small businesses to adopt more sophisticated web development strategies may increase demand for improved service over time.\\n Other studies indicate that the type and location of business activity may have a significant influence on demand for higher-speed broadband. The businesses covered in the North Carolina study were, by and large, small retail establishments in isolated rural areas.  Businesses in \"intermediate\" exurban locales that work in healthcare or knowledge-intensive sectors are more likely to use high-bandwidth applications, according to one study. [23] For example, a survey of local businesses by the Central Coast Broadband Consortium, a nonprofit representing independent broadband providers serving the greater Monterey Bay area, found that business respondents had significant data and file transfer needs.  [24] The area surveyed includes many sparsely populated rural areas with difficult terrain, but it is also home to significant tourist destinations, large agriculture enterprises, and a University of California campus, and its northern boundary extends to the exurbs of San Jose, one of the most highly developed technology hubs in the nation. `\\[R46108__8___1\\]`"

        "text": "### Market Demand and Private-Sector Investment\\n Observers often comment that rural broadband markets are hyper-local\u2014that is, that conditions affecting broadband deployment and adoption vary widely from one area to the next.  Historically, investments in broadband infrastructure have tended to cluster in areas with lower risk and potentially higher returns.  Broadband providers may view investment in rural markets with little history of internet usage as a high-risk endeavor.  Subsidies may lower financial risk to broadband providers, but do not change their basic preference for low-risk, high-return projects, which guides private sector investment in expansion of broadband service.\\n In a 2019 report, Merit Network, Inc., a nonprofit corporation owned and governed by Michigan\\\"s public universities, highlighted the business challenges faced by broadband providers in nascent rural broadband markets.  According to the report, \"Despite the significant qualitative benefits that a broadband project may bring, depending on the method of financing, it is critical to accurately estimate adoption rates and build a solid financial model to ensure that adequate revenue will be achieved to repay any loan obligations, maintain ongoing operations and fund depreciation of capital equipment. \" [25]\\n\\n\\n \"Even if rural areas are profitable for telecommunications companies, urban areas offer still higher returns on investment.  This makes rural areas less attractive markets and perpetuates the urban focus of market decisions,\" according to the authors of one academic study. \"The market for telecommunications shows that a free-market rationale can ensure an efficient use of limited resources, i.e. using the resources for profitable markets in high-density areas, but it cannot ensure an equal delivery of services in all areas, leaving the rural underserved. \" [29]\\n A 2019 report from the Arkansas governor\\\"s office stated that low broadband adoption rates \"have consistently been a primary barrier to investment by the provider community. \" Noting that age affects adoption rates, the report concluded that \"increased adoption within \\\\[the older\\\\] demographic has the potential to strengthen the business case for broadband deployment. \" [30] The Arkansas report also highlighted low statewide enrollment in the Lifeline program as a barrier to investment.  The FCC estimates that the Lifeline enrollment rate was 18% for Arkansas in 2018. [31] The Arkansas report found that \"raising adoption rates \\\\[of the Lifeline program\\\\] could also strengthen the business case for private companies to invest in broadband infrastructure, resulting in better internet access for both poor and non-poor Arkansans....  \" [32]\\n Studies elsewhere have found a similar relationship between demand and investment.  For example, in a 2015 report on its broadband expansion projects, the Appalachian Regional Commission, which serves 13 Appalachian states, found that \"broadband internet service providers \\\\[are\\\\] less likely to provide services in sparsely populated areas because it initially has a lower return on investment and is less cost-effective. \" [33] `\\[R46108__9___1\\]`"

[35] The primary legislative authority for the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program, and the Community Connect Grant Program, derives from the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, which Congress subsequently amended in various farm bills to support broadband buildout in rural areas.\\n Section 6103 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 ([P.L. 107-171](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d107:FLD002:@1(107+171))) amended the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to authorize the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program to provide funds for the costs of the construction, improvement, and acquisition of facilities and equipment for broadband service in eligible rural communities.  The 2018 farm bill ([P.L. 115-334](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+334)), Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018) authorized a grant component\u2014the Community Connect program\u2014in combination with the broadband loan program.  This provision increased the annual authorization level from \\\\$25 million to \\\\$350 million, raising the proposed service area eligibility threshold of unserved households from 15% to 50% for broadband loans; authorizing grants, loans, and loan guarantees for middle mile infrastructure; directing improved federal agency broadband program coordination; and providing eligible applicants with technical assistance and training to prepare applications.\\n Congress authorized the ReConnect Program separately through the annual appropriations process, funding it at \\\\$600 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 ([P.L. 115-141](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+141))). The ReConnect Program includes both loans and grants to promote broadband deployment in rural areas where 90% of households do not have sufficient access to broadband at 10 Mbps/1 Mbps.\\n Two additional programs also support broadband deployment in rural areas.

The Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), an independent not-for-profit organization, administers the USF under FCC direction.

        "text": "### FCC Service Benchmarks and Market Demand for Higher Speeds\\n The FCC changes its definition of broadband service as technologies, user expectations, and markets evolve.  It reviews its data speed benchmarks on an annual basis, and its decisions have regulatory implications that may affect private-sector investment decisions in rural areas.  The degree to which these benchmarks should be aspirational or reflect current market demand is a topic of frequent debate in policy circles.  Assessment of demand and its likely development over time informs many of these debates.\\n Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ([P.L. 104-104](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d104:FLD002:@1(104+104)); the Telecommunications Act) requires the FCC to report yearly on whether \"advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. \" The act does not specifically define advanced telecommunications capability, delegating this determination to the FCC.  It directs the FCC to \"take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market\" if its determination is negative.\\n Since 1999, there have been 11 Section 706 reports, each providing a snapshot and assessment of broadband deployment. [39] As part of this assessment, and to help determine whether broadband is being deployed in \"a reasonable and timely fashion,\" the FCC has established minimum data speeds that qualify as broadband service for the purposes of the Section 706 determination.  In 2015, citing changing broadband usage patterns and multiple devices using broadband within single households, the FCC raised its minimum fixed broadband benchmark speed from 4 megabits-per-second (Mbps) (download)/1 Mbps (upload) to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps.\\n The 25/3 Mbps threshold is meaningful in both technical and policy terms, because the legacy copper-based connections utilized by some broadband providers would likely require significant upgrades in order to meet higher thresholds.  [40] While fiber-based \"middle-mile\" cable has been broadly deployed over the last two decades, \"fiber-to-the-home\" installations that enable faster speeds are much less widespread, especially in remote rural areas.\\n Increases in minimum speed thresholds have frequently engendered policy debates about the regulatory role of the FCC and how best to allocate limited resources for broadband expansion. [41] Stakeholders in both the public and private sectors have frequently raised the issue of market demand for improved service when justifying their positions on the FCC\\\"s annual Section 706 determinations.\\n During the Obama Administration, FCC leadership justified increases in service speed thresholds as necessary to ensure that broadband infrastructure kept pace with changes in consumer behavior and the increasing number of bandwidth-hungry electronic devices and applications.  \"Application and service providers, consumers, and the broadband providers are all pointing to 25/3 as the new standard,\" wrote then-Chairman Tom Wheeler when commenting on the agency\\\"s 2015 progress report.  \"Content providers are increasingly offering high-quality video online, which uses a lot of bandwidth and could use a lot more as 4K video emerges. \" [42]\\n Opponents argued that demand does not justify investments in faster service that requires costly fiber-optic installations.  Two FCC commissioners then serving released dissenting statements, citing tepid demand for faster broadband service as a reason to refrain from mandating higher speeds.  Some criticized the FCC for subsidizing infrastructure buildout under one standard, which was then superseded by a new higher standard\u2014in effect designating newly built-out areas as unserved.  Commissioner Ajit Pai wrote, \"The driving factor in defining broadband should be consumer preference....  71% of consumers who can purchase fixed 25 Mbps service\u2014over 70 million households\u2014choose not to. \" [43]\\n As FCC Chairman since 2017, Pai has retained the 25/3 Mbps standard as sufficient to meet the Telecommunications Act requirement for the FCC to ensure availability of advanced telecommunications capabilities.  In public comments submitted for the 2019 FCC progress report, [44] some large broadband providers and associated trade and public policy groups expressed concerns that any increase of speed requirements beyond the existing 25/3 Mbps standard would impose unnecessary burdens on providers based on predicted cost and market demand.  [45] \"The Commission should not change benchmarks based on aspirations that do not reflect widespread consumer demand and that are not grounded in the text of Section 706,\" wrote the Free State Foundation. \"Instead, Section 706 implies a realistic analysis that takes stock of actual market data regarding deployment of infrastructure and the availability of advanced capabilities that a substantial majority or at least an early majority of consumers subscribe to. \" [46]\\n By contrast, rural co-ops and other independent broadband providers have tended to argue (directly or through trade associations) for a higher speed benchmark, which would lead to federal subsidization of higher-speed service.  [47] In a 2018 letter to a Member of Congress, the manager of an Iowa electric co-op wrote, \"Broadband systems funded with limited federal funds should meet the growing speed and data consumption needs of today and into the future....  \\\\[Congress\\\\] should recognize that in today\\\"s 21 \\\\[st\\\\] century economy, broadband systems built to 10/1 or slower speeds cannot support a modern household much less attract and retain new businesses. \" [48]\\n Trade organizations with memberships that include a cross-section of companies by size, corporate structure, and technology type have generally avoided discussing speed benchmarks in their submitted comments, focusing instead on other issues, such as substitutability of mobile broadband for fixed broadband. [49]\\n FCC data released as part of the 2019 progress report indicated that 25.3% of households in the nation\\\"s least rural counties where service was available had adopted 100/10 Mbps broadband\u2014more than double the 9.9% adoption rate in the nation\\\"s most rural counties (see ).  The same data indicated higher overall adoption of the current standard of 25/3 Mbps, with a 57.7% adoption in the least rural counties and 23.1% in the most rural.\\n\\n Some recent state and regional reports have questioned whether market demand justifies government-subsidized investment in higher speed broadband in all cases.  \"There is an ongoing, multifaceted debate about whether, where, and when the performance advantages of fiber justify the investment in upgrading communications networks,\" according to the Arkansas Development Finance Authority.  \"Most uses of the internet today do not require the capacity and speed that fiber internet offers, and internet service providers who deploy fiber don\\\"t necessarily experience strong demand for the upgraded service. \" [50] According to an April 2019 report from the Southeastern Indiana Regional Planning Commission, \"Some providers argue that even when broadband is available, customers do not subscribe as expected. \" [51] The authors argued for energetic measures to promote broadband affordability and adoption as a remedy. `\\[R46108__15___1\\]`"

        "text": "### Federal Programs\\\" Consideration of Market Demand When Awarding Funds for Broadband Infrastructure Buildout\\n The primary purpose of the RUS and USF High Cost programs is to support expansion of broadband availability in unserved or underserved areas, rather than to promote broadband adoption. [52] Funding under these programs has typically been awarded based on ISP commitments to making a certain level of service available to a certain number of eligible households and businesses within a certain period of time.  However, there are some important differences.\\n The RUS programs include loans, which recipients must repay.  Applicants for funding under the Rural Broadband Access Loan program are required to complete and submit a financial forecast to demonstrate that they can repay the loan, and that the proposed project \"is financially feasible and sustainable. \" [53] The forecast must include\u2014with few exceptions\u2014a market survey that describes service packages and rates, and provides the number of existing and proposed subscribers.  [54] This requirement may incentivize recipients to encourage adoption in their service areas in order to increase revenues that they can then use for loan repayment.  At the same time, it may also deter providers from accepting loans to serve areas where the business case for deployment is particularly difficult. [55]\\n Perhaps because of disincentives for investment in unattractive markets, RUS selection criteria and loan terms prioritize buildout to unserved or underserved areas over subscription rates or other business performance metrics.  According to the application guide, \"Priority must be given to applicants that propose to offer broadband service to the greatest proportion of households that, prior to the provision of the broadband service, had no incumbent service provider. \" [56] Program administrators prioritize projects according to four tiers, which range from 25% to 100% of households unserved.  The standard loan term is 3 years, but applicants can request up to a 35-year repayment term and a principal deferral period of up to 4 years if at least 50% of the households in the proposed service area are unserved. [57]\\n The RUS ReConnect program has similar goals, but also includes grants and loan-grant combinations.  Applicants can likewise request more generous loan terms if they plan to serve a Substantially Underserved Trust Area (typically tribal lands), and their application may be granted priority status.  Reviewers score applications against evaluation criteria using a points-based system.  They award points for population density (less dense areas receiving preference), number of farms served, number of businesses served, number of educational facilities served, performance of the offered services, and other criteria. [58] Neither projected business performance metrics nor adoption rates are included in the evaluation criteria.\\n Under the High Cost program, federal subsidies are premised on the absence of a business case for broadband expansion.  In announcing the latest proposed round of support, known as the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF), the FCC stated that it would prioritize buildout in areas where \"there is currently no private sector business case to deploy broadband without assistance. \" [59] USF programs only require that participating broadband providers advertise the availability of broadband service within their service areas, and that the broadband provider be able to provide service at rates \"reasonably comparable to rates offered in urban areas\" to any area household within 10 business days if requested to do so.  Census blocks\u2014the administrative-territorial unit used by the FCC to measure broadband coverage\u2014are considered served if a local broadband provider meets these conditions.  As with the RUS programs, the High Cost program has prioritized buildout and higher broadband performance over adoption. Phase I of the proposed RDOF program would prioritize support to broadband providers that serve \"completely unserved areas\" at higher data speeds, higher usage allowances, and lower latency, but sets no specific adoption benchmarks.  [60]\\n The FCC expressed concerns in its RDOF proposal that recipients of support might lack any incentive to aggressively market their services or otherwise stimulate demand beyond relatively low-cost high-return areas, and might even take measures to limit subscription in order to protect profits.\\n Since \\\\[RDOF\\\\] support may require certain providers to offer much higher data caps than they do to \\\\[non-RDOF\\\\] subscribers and price the services similarly, such providers may have an incentive to limit \\\\[RDOF\\\\] subscribers to sell their capacity to more profitable \\\\[non-RDOF\\\\] subscribers.  Spectrum-based providers that do not have a network sufficient to serve most locations in a geographic area would also have an incentive to limit subscription if expanding capacity would be less profitable than limiting subscription and collecting \\\\[RDOF\\\\] subsidies based purely on deployment.  Even wireline bidders may lack the proper incentives to serve additional customers in some areas, given that it may not be profitable without a per-subscriber payment to run wires from the street to the customer location and install customer premises equipment.  [61]\\n Having expressed these concerns, the FCC put forward a proposal to introduce subscribership milestones for RDOF recipients.  It requested comment on several different implementation options.  One proposal would offer a baseline level of support to broadband providers and then add per-subscriber payments.  Another would withhold a certain percentage of support if broadband providers failed to meet subscription milestones, although it raised the question of what milestones were appropriate given \"the unique challenges of serving rural areas.\" [62] Eliciting private sector participation in rural broadband programs appears to be a concern for the FCC, just as it is for USDA.  In its last round of USF funding support, FCC increased the term of support to broadband providers from 5 years to 10 years in order to gain \"robust participation\" in the program.

        "text": "## End-User Subsidies\\n The FCC\\\"s Lifeline program is the only major federal broadband program that directly targets broadband adoption by residential subscribers. [64] It targets households earning less than 135% of the federal poverty level.  Program enrollment rates vary widely by state, with a nationwide average of 28% of eligible beneficiaries.  [65] The program subsidizes enrollees to cover the recurring monthly service charges associated with broadband subscribership.  Support is not given directly to the subscriber but to the subscriber-selected service provider. Although stimulating broadband demand is not an explicit purpose of the Lifeline program, expansion of Lifeline enrollment may improve the business case for broadband deployment in rural areas, which on average have a disproportionately high number of low-income residents.\\n In many cases, facilities-based telecommunications providers sell excess capacity in areas they already serve to resellers, who then rebrand the service and market low-cost plans to eligible Lifeline beneficiaries.  In 2017, the FCC proposed changes to the Lifeline program that would bar resellers from participation.  [66] Some in Congress claimed that these changes would reduce enrollment by 70% from current levels.  [67]\\n In a further action, the proposed FCC update to Lifeline minimum service standards for 2019 raised concerns in some quarters that low-income subscribers would be priced out of the market by required upgrades.  In a letter to the FCC, NTCA\u2014The Rural Broadband Association wrote that unless the FCC requirement is waived, \"current Lifeline subscribers to fixed broadband service will be forced to upgrade to a higher speed tier than they may need, want, or have the ability to afford\u2014resulting in either stretched consumer budgets or the potential for price-sensitive customers to cease buying broadband altogether. \" [68] The FCC stated that the increase was required under provisions of the 2016 Lifeline Order. [69] In its November 2019 decision, the FCC retained the existing subsidy level for broadband service and increased the monthly data minimums from 2 gigabytes to 3 gigabytes\u2014a reduction from the 8.75 gigabyte minimum originally proposed.

        "text": "## Outreach and Education Programs\\n The federal government has supported numerous broadband-related outreach and education activities over the years, typically as part of broad-ranging development grant programs focused primarily on housing and education.  Agencies providing grant support of this type include the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, and Commerce, as well as the National Science Foundation and several regional development commissions.  [71]\\n The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) is an exception to this pattern, as it includes dedicated funding for broadband adoption programs.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ([P.L. 111-5](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d111:FLD002:@1(111+5))) provided approximately \\\\$4 billion for BTOP, to be administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA, an agency of the Department of Commerce) as a program including broadband infrastructure grants, grants for expanding public computer capacity, and grants to encourage sustainable adoption of broadband service.  As of August 2015, BTOP had awarded \\\\$3.48 billion for infrastructure buildout, \\\\$201 million for public computer centers, and \\\\$250.7 million for sustainable broadband adoption. [72] Most BTOP funds have been expended, but NTIA continues to monitor existing grants. [73]\\n A 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that affordability, lack of perceived relevance, and lack of computer skills are the \"principal barriers\" to broadband adoption.  It identified outreach and training, along with discounts, as \"key approaches\" to addressing those barriers.  Regarding BTOP, it noted, \"NTIA compiled and published self-reported information from its BTOP grantees about best practices, but has not assessed the effectiveness of these approaches in addressing adoption barriers. \" [74] In a response to the GAO, the Deputy Secretary of Commerce wrote that grant recipients were individually responsible for program design and assessments of program effectiveness.

Deployment of broadband is not uniform across the United States.  Some areas lack broadband entirely\u2014creating a so-called digital divide between those who have access to broadband service and those who do not. Although some public entities (e.g., municipalities) provide broadband service, broadband is primarily deployed by the private sector.  Private sector providers typically make their deployment decisions based on economic criteria, such as whether an area will provide a sufficient return on investment.  They may therefore choose not to serve communities that have a lower population density (i.e., rural or remote areas) if they conclude that the cost to provide service would outweigh the returns.  The terrain in some rural or remote areas may also make some technologies\u2014such as fiber optic cable\u2014more expensive to deploy.  In such cases, it may not make economic sense for providers to deploy broadband in the absence of some type of subsidy to offset their costs.  Federal support for broadband deployment comes primarily from three agencies\u2014the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (an agency in the Department of Commerce).  Other federal agencies have programs that fund broadband deployment as one among many possible activities, but in most cases broadband is not the primary eligible funding activity.  The federal government has been providing support for broadband deployment for decades; progress has been made, but the digital divide persists.  To deploy federal resources effectively, an accurate national picture of where broadband is and is not available is key.  The FCC has responsibility for mapping broadband availability, but ensuring the accuracy of the data has been challenging, and the federal government does not know precisely where broadband has and has not been deployed.  Another issue is that broadband takes time to deploy, especially if there are supply chain problems, labor shortages, or delays in administration of federal funding.  The digital divide puzzle is complex and has many pieces.  Additional funding for broadband deployment may not alone be enough to close it.  The 118th Congress may also assess whether regulatory policies are helping or hindering broadband deployment and weigh how changes in regulatory policies could help.  Possible considerations include \uf0b7 the sufficiency of federal broadband funding and whether more is needed, \uf0b7 the numerous federal agencies and programs involved in promoting broadband deployment, which could lead to coordination issues or duplication of effort, \uf0b7 the FCC\u2019s minimum broadband speed benchmark and whether raising the speed benchmark could inadvertently create a new digital divide, \uf0b7 the potential for prioritization of unserved areas to ensure ubiquitous broadband availability, and \uf0b7 the potential application of rural electrification strategies to rural broadband deployment.  Policy options proposed in bills currently under consideration by the 118th Congress include, for example, prioritizing the processing of applications for rural broadband projects located in areas with the shortest construction seasons (H.R. 43), amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude certain broadband grants from gross income (H.R. 889/S.  341), determining whether the lack of network equipment significantly impacted the deployment of broadband (S. 690), and ensuring that broadband maps are accurate before funds are allocated under the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (S. 1162).

Deployment of broadband is not uniform across the United States.  Some areas lack broadband entirely\u2014creating a so-called digital divide between those who have access to broadband service and those who do not. Although some public entities (e.g., municipalities) provide broadband service, broadband is primarily deployed by the private sector.  Private sector providers typically make their deployment decisions based on economic criteria, such as whether an area will provide a sufficient return on investment.  They may therefore choose not to serve communities that have a lower population density (i.e., rural or remote areas) if they conclude that the cost to provide service would outweigh the returns.  The terrain in some rural or remote areas may also make some technologies\u2014such as fiber optic cable\u2014more expensive to deploy.  In such cases, it may not make economic sense for providers to deploy broadband in the absence of some type of subsidy to offset their costs.  Federal support for broadband deployment comes primarily from three agencies\u2014the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (an agency in the Department of Commerce).  Other federal agencies have programs that fund broadband deployment as one among many possible activities, but in most cases broadband is not the primary eligible funding activity.  The federal government has been providing support for broadband deployment for decades; progress has been made, but the digital divide persists.  To deploy federal resources effectively, an accurate national picture of where broadband is and is not available is key.  The FCC has responsibility for mapping broadband availability, but ensuring the accuracy of the data has been challenging, and the federal government does not know precisely where broadband has and has not been deployed.  Another issue is that broadband takes time to deploy, especially if there are supply chain problems, labor shortages, or delays in administration of federal funding.  The digital divide puzzle is complex and has many pieces.  Additional funding for broadband deployment may not alone be enough to close it.  The 118th Congress may also assess whether regulatory policies are helping or hindering broadband deployment and weigh how changes in regulatory policies could help.  Possible considerations include \\uf0b7 the sufficiency of federal broadband funding and whether more is needed, \\uf0b7 the numerous federal agencies and programs involved in promoting broadband deployment, which could lead to coordination issues or duplication of effort, \\uf0b7 the FCC\u2019s minimum broadband speed benchmark and whether raising the speed benchmark could inadvertently create a new digital divide, \\uf0b7 the potential for prioritization of unserved areas to ensure ubiquitous broadband availability, and \\uf0b7 the potential application of rural electrification strategies to rural broadband deployment.  Policy options proposed in bills currently under consideration by the 118th Congress include, for example, prioritizing the processing of applications for rural broadband projects located in areas with the shortest construction seasons (H.R. 43), amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude certain broadband grants from gross income (H.R. 889/S.  341), determining whether the lack of network equipment significantly impacted the deployment of broadband (S. 690), and ensuring that broadband maps are accurate before funds are allocated under the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (S. 1162).

It can be delivered through various technologies, such as \\uf0b7 digital subscriber line (DSL), which uses copper telephone wires to transmit data; \\uf0b7 cable modem, which uses the same coaxial cables used for cable television; \\uf0b7 fiber optic cable, which uses pulses of light shot by lasers through thin strands of glass; \\uf0b7 wireless, which uses a radio connection between a user\u2019s device, such as a laptop or phone, and a service provider\u2019s terrestrial antenna; and \\uf0b7 satellite, which uses a radio connection between a user\u2019s device and a service provider\u2019s space-based antenna.1  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\u2014an independent agency over which Congress has oversight\u2014has set a minimum speed benchmark as its definition of broadband.  The benchmark, adopted in 2015, is 25 megabits per second (Mbps) to download data and 3 Mbps to upload data.  This benchmark is referred to as \u201c25/3.\u201d2 Broadband has become increasingly important as aspects of everyday life continue to move online.  This trend became especially apparent during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with activities such as school and work moving from in-person to online.  However, not everyone in the United States has equal access to broadband.  The gap between those who have access to broadband and those who do not is referred to as the digital divide.  The term originated at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the mid-1990s \u201cto express the gap between \u2018haves\u2019 and \u2018have-nots\u2019 in terms of access to computers. \u201d3 The term has evolved to include other aspects of technology access, especially broadband availability.  Despite billions of federal dollars directed toward broadband deployment, discrepancies in access to broadband remain.  The continuing lack of broadband access in some areas can be attributed to several factors, including terrain, population density, demography, and market characteristics.  Rural and tribal areas are most affected, but urban areas can also be.  This report provides an overview of the digital divide in broadband deployment and issues that contribute to it persistence.  The report includes a discussion of policy issues facing Congress.

        "text": "*The Persistent Broadband Digital Divide: Selected Deployment Issues and Considerations* **Broadband Availability Data and Mapping Challenges** Pinpointing where broadband is and is not deployed across the United States has been challenging.  Estimates of how many Americans lack access to broadband vary\u2014ranging, for example, from the FCC\u2019s estimate of 14.5 million10 to an estimate by BroadbandNow of 42 million11 to Microsoft\u2019s estimate of 157.3 million.12  Without an accurate figure, it is difficult for policymakers to know how much funding would potentially help close the divide\u2014and where to direct it. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel stated in a June 30, 2022, blog post: For as long as people have been talking about the digital divide, there have been complaints that we lack detailed maps to tell us exactly where broadband is\u2014and is not\u2014available.  This has been a constant source of frustration for policymakers trying to deploy resources to build broadband in more places as well as consumers, who knew with greater accuracy than Washington about their what broadband service was available where they lived or worked.13  The FCC has had primary responsibility for developing a comprehensive map of broadband access in the United States since 2018,14 but the data and methodology used to compose the map may have overstated availability.  For example, an entire census block15 was considered as served if at least one home or business in that census block had broadband access.  This policy could have consequences for efforts to address the digital divide, as the FCC\u2019s map is frequently consulted to identify areas that are completely unserved with broadband, and thus, to determine where to invest federal resources through programs such as the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) and the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program.16  Many Members of Congress have acknowledged the potential implications of inaccurate broadband data and mapping.

        "text": "*The Persistent Broadband Digital Divide: Selected Deployment Issues and Considerations* In March 2020, Congress enacted the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act (Broadband DATA Act; P.L. 116-130).  This law required the FCC to change how broadband data is collected, verified, and reported.  For example, the law requires specific location-level information about broadband services available throughout the country and implementation of a public challenge process in which consumers, state, local, and tribal governments, and other stakeholders (e.g., internet service providers) can submit challenges to the FCC if they believe the map required under the act\u2014referred to as the National Broadband Map\u2014contains inaccurate data (e.g., overstated availability of broadband service).  The pre-production version of the National Broadband Map debuted on November 18, 2022, to mixed reviews.  Some stakeholders acknowledge that, although some issues persist, the map is an improvement from the previous version, and they have applauded the FCC for its efforts.18  Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns.  For example, on December 21, 2022, multiple Senators wrote a letter to Chairwoman Rosenworcel, stating, We have heard from constituents, state and local governments, and service providers alike of continuing concerns about the accuracy of the map, ranging from persistent issues with missing or incorrect serviceable locations to potentially overstated claims of coverage by providers.19 Additionally, news outlets have reported that some providers may have submitted false broadband availability data to the FCC.20  The digital divide will be difficult to close unless areas unserved with broadband are accurately identified.  Congress may consider additional legislative actions, such as enhancing accountability protocols for data submitted by providers, penalizing providers that provide false or inaccurate data, or increasing the frequency of updates to the National Broadband Map.21  To assist with improving the accuracy of the map, state and local governments have been encouraging residents to check their address on the National Broadband Map and challenge incorrect information.22  The map is to be updated at least twice a year with the resolution of consumer challenges, along with updated service provider data on availability.23  Although the share-of-federal-broadband-grants, and *Rep.

        "text": "*The Persistent Broadband Digital Divide: Selected Deployment Issues and Considerations* challenge process may result in more accurate data, it remains to be seen whether national mapping of where broadband is and is not available will continue to pose a challenge.  This issue has been a particular focus of congressional interest in light of the \\\\$42.45 billion BEAD program, which is required by law to use the National Broadband Map to determine how much BEAD funding a state is to receive based on the state\u2019s share of unserved locations.  **State Variability and Cost to Deploy** Areas of the United States vary dramatically in terms of landform, climate, and settlement patterns.  There are mountains in the West, semi-arid grasslands in the Great Plains, and wilderness in Alaska.  Such variations can present challenges in deploying broadband.  Climatic variations, for example, may allow the deployment of buried cables all year in some places (e.g., some parts of California), while others may have ground that is frozen for long periods (e.g., Michigan) and may therefore have to pause deployment efforts at certain times of year.  In the 118th Congress, the Rural Broadband Window of Opportunity Act (H.R. 43) would require the FCC to prioritize the processing of applications for certain rural broadband expansion projects that are located in areas with the shortest construction seasons (generally areas with long winters and heavy snowfall).  Of the technologies used to deliver broadband, fiber is typically preferred by both consumers and providers due to its reliability (fiber cables are typically buried underground) and scalability (i.e., flexibility to accommodate higher speeds in the future).24  Additionally, fiber can provide symmetrical speeds of up to 1,000 Mbps and lower latency (i.e., lag time) than other technologies.25 However, geography can make laying fiber challenging as, in many cases, deploying fiber requires subsurface digging to bury conduit and physically connecting each household.  Returns on investment typically drive broadband deployment decisions.  Areas in which it is difficult and expensive to deploy broadband (e.g., mountains) often make little economic sense for providers.26  According to Pew Charitable Trusts, \u201ccost is one obstacle to extending broadband internet to everyone who wants it.  The companies providing the services need adequate returns to justify their investment in the necessary fiber, towers, and cables. \u201d27 months, our mapping team has processed challenges to availability data for over 4 million locations.  In other words, on average, we are addressing availability challenges to tens of thousands of locations every single day.  Every two weeks, our public map is updated to reflect all availability challenges that have been resolved. \u201d See Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, *The National Broadband Map\u2014Getting Better All the Time*, Federal Communications Commission, March 23, 2023, available at https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/notes/2023/03/23/national-broadband-map-getting- better-all-time.  24 Fiber Broadband Association, *Fiber Broadband Association Releases Broadband Experience Index*, October 21, 2019, available at https://www.fiberbroadband.org/blog/fiber-broadband-association-releases-broadband-experience- index.  25 Tyler Cooper, \u201cDSL vs. Cable vs. Fiber: Which Internet Option Is the Best? ,\u201d BroadbandNow, May 6, 2022, available at https://broadbandnow.com/guides/dsl-vs-cable-vs-fiber.

        "text": "*The Persistent Broadband Digital Divide: Selected Deployment Issues and Considerations* According to Fierce Telecom, \u201cmiddle mile access is a huge issue that drives up the cost of rural fiber deployments. \u201d33 Further, much of the middle mile infrastructure needed across the United States for last mile connectivity does not currently exist.  According to Matthew Rantanen, technology and telecommunications co-chairman of the National Congress of American Indians, The middle-mile fiber is missing.  We did the math, got maps from carriers and tribes, worked with the GIS \\\\[geographic information system\\\\] folks and anchor institutions\u2014 there\u2019s about 8,000 missing miles in the Lower 48 states, 1,800 just in California.  That\u2019s a billion-dollar problem on its own just in the Lower 48.34 A consideration for Congress is whether the government might consider funding middle mile infrastructure that would be too costly for private providers without subsidies.  While Congress provided \\\\$1 billion in funding for middle mile infrastructure in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58)\u2014which is being administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)35\u2014whether that funding resolves the lack of middle mile infrastructure, or whether additional funding might be needed remains to be seen.  Fiber is not the only broadband technology that may be costly to deploy.  Many providers, including winners from the FCC\u2019s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) auctions, are using a technology called fixed wireless access (FWA), which \u201cis a way of providing wireless connectivity through radio links between two fixed points. \u201d36 According to Fierce Telecom, \u201cwhile FWA deployments are generally cheaper than fiber \u2026 in a place like Alaska, even getting a tower built is going to be much more expensive given the rural nature of the roads, lack of rural electricity at a tower site, and mountain topography. \u201d37 In places where fiber or FWA may not be feasible to deploy\u2014due to cost or geography\u2014other technologies may be able to step in and help fill the gap.  For example, broadband provided by satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) may hold promise, especially in remote or rural areas.  LEO satellites, which are positioned at a much lower altitude than geostationary (GEO) satellites, have the potential to deliver broadband speeds closer to those that can be achieved with fiber, as well as lower lag times or latency.  However, there are many unknowns\u2014for example, whether LEO satellites can consistently provide the anticipated lower latency and higher speeds.38  Although fiber may be the preferred technology by consumers and providers, other technologies may be best suited for particular areas (e.g., LEO satellites in remote areas) and each community has different challenges a particular technology might be able to address.  An additional consideration for Congress could be whether some states (e.g., ones that have challenging terrain) may require uniquely tailored plans to close the digital divide.  33 Diana Goovaerts, \u201cFBA CEO Says \u2018No One Too Expensive to Reach\u2019 with Fiber,\u201d Fierce Telecom, September 28, 2022, available at https://www.fiercetelecom.com/broadband/fba-ceo-says-no-one-too-expensive-reach-fiber. 34 Robert Chaney, \u201cBroadband Funding for Native Communities Could Finally Connect Some of America\u2019s Most Isolated Places,\u201d *MIT Technology Review*, September 21, 2022, available at https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/ 09/21/1059682/pandemic-broadband-funding-native-communities-blackfeet-internet-access/. 35 National Telecommunications and Information Administration, *Enabling Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure Program*, available at https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/enabling-middle-mile-broadband-infrastructure-program. 36 everythingRF, \u201cWhat Is Fixed Wireless Access?,\u201d May 28, 2020, available at https://www.everythingrf.com/ community/what-is-fixed-wireless-access.  37 Diana Goovaerts, \u201cThe Cost of Running Fiber in Rural America: \\\\$200,000 per Passing,\u201d Fierce Telecom, September 27, 2022, available at https://www.fiercetelecom.com/broadband/cost-running-fiber-rural-america-200000-passing. 38 For more information see CRS Report R46896, *Low Earth Orbit Satellites: Potential to Address the Broadband Digital Divide*, by Colby Leigh Rachfal.

        "text": "*The Persistent Broadband Digital Divide: Selected Deployment Issues and Considerations* **Network Construction Time and Other Potential Delays** Many policymakers see closing the digital divide as urgent, but the time it takes to deploy broadband infrastructure may pose a challenge in providing an immediate solution. According to Dgtl Infra Real Estate 2.0, As a general rule, fiber construction takes 6 to 10 months for a network to become operational, after the beginning of a build-out.  However, the construction timeline for a new fiber optic network varies depending upon the number of route miles to be constructed, the number of homes or premises targeted for connection to the network, and the general deployment of the network.39 Broadband can take even longer to deploy if an entity is receiving federal funding to construct a network.  For example, the FCC\u2019s RDOF was announced in January 2020, with a reverse auction40 held in December 2020.  Following the auction, the FCC began reviewing long-form applications41 from winning bidders.  It did not begin approving disbursement of support until July 2021.  Approvals are still ongoing as of the publication of this report.  Similarly, a January 24, 2023, Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that announcement of awards for NTIA\u2019s Broadband Infrastructure and Tribal Broadband Connectivity Programs took longer than anticipated.  For example, award announcements for the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program were expected in November 2021, but as of September 2022, awards were still being announced on a rolling basis.42  Further, because of construction milestones\u2014typically measured in years\u2014 communities may have to wait years after an award is announced before they actually receive broadband service.  For example, funding recipients under RDOF have eight years to serve all locations (i.e., homes and businesses).43  Factors other than construction and administrative delays can also slow deployment.  For example, workforce challenges\u2014such as labor shortages\u2014may contribute to the length of time to construct a network.  Stakeholders have differing perspectives on whether broadband workforce shortages will pose a challenge to closing the digital divide.  A December 15, 2022, GAO report \u201cfound that thousands more skilled workers will be needed to deploy broadband and 5G funded by recent federal programs....  We found mixed evidence on whether there\u2019s a shortage of these workers. \u201d44 Congress may consider whether to direct federal agencies to collect additional data on the broadband workforce to help determine whether a workforce shortage exists, and, if so, how that might negatively affect efforts to close the digital divide.  Additionally, Congress could consider directing the FCC, NTIA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to collect information from grant recipients on any difficulties experienced in securing skilled technicians for 39 Jonathan Kim, *Fiber Optic Network Construction: Process and Build Costs*, Dgtl Infra, July 28, 2022, available at https://dgtlinfra.com/fiber-optic-network-construction-process-costs/. 40 In a reverse auction, the lowest bidder wins.  41 According to the FCC, \u201cwinning bidders must provide in their long-form applications additional information about qualifications, funding, and the network that they intend to use to meet their obligations. \u201d See Federal Communications Commission, *Auction 904: Rural Digital Opportunity Fund*, available at https://www.fcc.gov/auction/904/factsheet.  42 Government Accountability Office, *Broadband Funding: Stronger Management of Performance and Fraud Risk Needed for Tribal and Public-Private Partnership Grants*, January 24, 2023, available at https://www.gao.gov/ products/gao-23-105426.  43 Federal Communications Commission, *Auction 904: Rural Digital Opportunity Fund*, available at https://www.fcc.gov/auction/904/factsheet.  44 Government Accountability Office, *Telecommunications Workforce: Additional Workers Will Be Needed to Deploy Broadband, but Concerns Exist About Availability*, December 15, 2022, available at https://www.gao.gov/products/ gao-23-105626.

Initiatives such as these may take years to develop, which can make it challenging to address workforce shortages in a timely manner (e.g., if it takes time to set up a training program and train a useful number of workers, the shortage may have resolved itself by the time the training is completed).  Broadband providers may continue to face shortages in the supply chain (e.g., fiber optic cable, electronic equipment) which can add time to deployment.46  For example, in 2021, AT&T stated that it had planned to build fiber to 3 million homes, but would only actually build to around 2.5 million, mainly due to supply chain issues.47  Supply chain issues could delay Vermont\u2019s plan to bring fiber optic service to every home on the electric grid within five years, as wait times for some materials are now one year.48  Supply chain issues can be attributed to multiple factors.  For example, the COVID-19 pandemic increased demand for broadband with the shift to telework and distance learning activities.  At the same time, production was stalled \u201cas factories were forced to limit shifts or close. \u201d49 Further, with the influx of federal funding for broadband\u2014 particularly in the IIJA\u2014many providers are competing for materials at the same time.50  Some Members of Congress introduced legislation in the 117th Congress seeking to address supply chain issues.  For example, the Network Equipment Transparency Act (S. 3692) would have required the FCC to determine (every two years) whether the lack of network equipment significantly impacted the deployment of broadband.  That legislation has been reintroduced as S. 690 in the 118th Congress.  **Policy Issues for Congress** In addition to the oversight issues already discussed, Congress may seek to address a number of other topics: \\uf0b7 the adequacy of funding provided to date, and potential needs for additional funds; 45 For more information see CRS In Focus IF12111, *Bridging the Digital Divide: Broadband Workforce Considerations for the 118th Congress*, by Colby Leigh Rachfal.  46 Cathy Cash, \u201cDown to the Wire: A Perfect Storm of Shortages Threatens to Douse Rural Broadband Progress,\u201d *Rural Electric Magazine*, August 1, 2021, available at https://www.cooperative.com/remagazine/articles/pages/kinks- in-the-chain-a-perfect-storm-of-shortages-threatens-to-douse-rural-broadband-progress.aspx. 47 Deborah Kish, \u201cThe Vicious Cycle of the Supply Chain in Fiber Broadband\u2014Is an End in Sight? ,\u201d *Broadband Communities Magazine*, November 2021, available at https://www.bbcmag.com/community-broadband/the-vicious- cycle-of-the-supply-chain-in-fiber-broadband-is-an-end-in-sight.  48 Fred Thys, \u201cSupply Issues Drive Vermont Broadband Timeline,\u201d *Valley News*, April 24, 2022, available at https://www.vnews.com/broadband-rollout-may-take-longer-than-helped-46069936. 49 Cathy Cash, \u201cDown to the Wire: A Perfect Storm of Shortages Threatens to Douse Rural Broadband Progress,\u201d *Rural Electric Magazine*, August 1, 2021, available at https://www.erative.com/remagazine/articles/pages/kinks-in-the- chain-a-perfect-storm-of-shortages-threatens-to-douse-rural-broadband-progress.aspx. 50 Alex Goldman, *Supply Chain Will Challenge US Fiber, Fixed Wireless Rural Broadband Rollouts*, Fiber Broadband Association, December 10, 2021, available at https://optics.fiberbroadband.org/Full-Article/supply-chain-will- challenge-us-fiber-fixed-wireless-rural-broadband-rollouts-1.

Each of these issues is discussed in greater detail below.  **Potential Funding** Congress has provided billions of dollars to close the digital divide\u2014most recently, the \\\\$65 billion broadband investment in the IIJA (P.L. 117-58).  However, it remains to be seen whether the funding allocated in the IIJA for broadband will close the digital divide.  In 2017, the FCC\u2019s Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis estimated that it would cost approximately \\\\$80 billion to connect every U.S. household to fiber\u2014with the cost to connect the last 2% of households (mostly in remote areas) estimated at approximately \\\\$40 billion.51  Some critics do not believe the \\\\$65 billion allocated by the IIJA will be enough to close the digital divide.  Estimates vary with respect to how much additional funding would be needed.  According to a Tufts University study, \u201cat least \\\\$240 billion is needed to close the digital divide\u2014\\\\$175 billion more than the \\\\$65 billion allocated. \u201d52 A study conducted by America\u2019s Communications Association Connects (ACA Connects) estimates that it could take between \\\\$20 billion and \\\\$198 billion to connect all homes and businesses to broadband service\u2014with higher broadband speeds involving higher costs.53  Another study by Vantage Point Solutions (VPS) found the cost could exceed \\\\$400 billion.54  An article by Techdirt states, \u201can analysis of broadband deployment by the \\\\[Wall Street\\\\] Journal found, unsurprisingly, that funding has been thrown numerous times at the same regions that are still \u2026 somehow waiting for modern-era broadband to arrive. \u201d55 Mapping broadband availability may help; however, according to the VPS report, \u201ceven if the number of locations that need upgrades to receive broadband were known precisely, it remains a difficult task to determine the cost to construct broadband networks throughout the United States. \u201d56 The report further states, \u201cunderground fiber construction may cost less than \\\\$20,000 per mile in some areas, but be more 51 Paul de Sa, *Improving the Nation\u2019s Digital Infrastructure*, Federal Communications Commission, January 17, 2017, p. 2, available at https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-343135A1.pdf.  52 Bhaskar Chakravorti, \u201cHow to Close the Digital Divide in the U.S.,\u201d *Harvard Business Review*, July 20, 2021, available at https://hbr.org/2021/07/how-to-close-the-digital-divide-in-the-u-s.  53 Cartesian, *Addressing Gaps in Broadband Infrastructure Availability and Service Adoption*, June 2021, p. 11, available at https://acaconnects.org/index.php? checkfileaccess=/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Addressing-Gaps-in- Broadband-Infrastructure-Availability-and-Service-Adoption-ACA-Connects-and-Cartesian-June2021.pdf. 54 Vantage Point Solutions, *Cost of Bringing Broadband to All*, August 1, 2022, p. 3, available at https://www.fcc.gov/ ecfs/document/108012327916993/2.  55 Karl Bode, \u201cWe Just Keep Throwing Billions at Telecom Monopolies in Exchange for Half-Completed, Shitty Broadband Networks,\u201d Techdirt, June 17, 2022, available at https://www.techdirt.com/2022/06/17/we-just-keep- throwing-billions-at-telecom-monopolies-in-exchange-for-half-completed-shitty-broadband-networks/. 56 Vantage Point Solutions, *Cost of Bringing Broadband to All*, August 1, 2022, p. 7, available at https://www.fcc.gov/ ecfs/document/108012327916993/2.

        "text": "*The Persistent Broadband Digital Divide: Selected Deployment Issues and Considerations* **FCC Minimum Broadband Speed Benchmark and Prioritization of Unserved Versus Served Areas** Section 706(a) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104) directs the FCC to determine whether broadband is deployed to all Americans on a reasonable and timely basis.  As part of this effort, the FCC sets a minimum broadband speed benchmark to define what it considers broadband service.  In 2015, the FCC set that benchmark speed to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps, which remains in place today.  The definition of what constitutes broadband service can have implications for federal policies targeted toward closing the digital divide.  For example, on July 15, 2022, Chairwoman Rosenworcel proposed increasing the minimum broadband benchmark speed to 100 Mbps/20 Mbps.66  According to the FCC\u2019s Fourteenth Broadband Deployment Report, approximately 14.5 million Americans do not have access to broadband at speeds of 25/3 Mbps\u2014meaning these areas are considered as unserved.67  If the FCC were to raise the broadband speed benchmark, any areas that have 25/3 Mbps, but are not served with the new minimum speed benchmark, would be considered unserved with broadband.  This could exacerbate the digital divide, as federal funds intended to provide service to areas without 25/3 Mbps service might be redirected to upgrade speeds in areas that already have 25/3 Mbps service but do not meet the new faster benchmark.  On the other hand, raising the FCC\u2019s minimum speed benchmark might make it more likely that the FCC would find that broadband deployment is not occurring in a reasonable and timely fashion.  This could cause the FCC to take further action in the form of new broadband programs or initiatives to speed deployment, or regulatory action\u2014such as streamlining infrastructure deployment rules.68  In many cases, federal broadband programs outside the FCC have set other speed thresholds for networks built using federal funds.  For example, while the Treasury Department uses a 100/100 Mbps standard for capital projects funded through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117-2),69 the NTIA\u2019s BEAD program requires grant recipients to build to a minimum of 100/20 Mbps.70  Different agencies setting varying speed thresholds may cause inconsistencies in closing the digital divide.  Congress might consider specifying a single benchmark as the standard for all federal agencies administering broadband programs, or directing all agencies to use the FCC benchmark. Some policymakers believe that those who currently lack broadband entirely should be prioritized to prevent duplication in areas that already have some level of broadband access.  For example, on February 4, 2022, some Members of Congress wrote to NTIA, urging the agency to prioritize 66 Federal Communications Commission, *Chairwoman Rosenworcel Proposes to Increase Minimum Broadband Speeds*, July 15, 2022, available at https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-rosenworcel-proposes-increase- minimum-broadband-speeds.  67 Federal Communications Commission, *Fourteenth Broadband Deployment Report*, January 19, 2021, p. 2, available at https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/fourteenth-broadband-deployment-report. 68 For more information see CRS In Focus IF11875, *Raising the Minimum Fixed Broadband Speed Benchmark: Background and Selected Issues*, by Colby Leigh Rachfal.  69 U.S. Department of Treasury, *Guidance for the Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund for States, Territories & Freely Associated States*, September 2021, p. 3, available at https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Capital-Projects-Fund- Guidance-States-Territories-and-Freely-Associated-States.pdf.  70 National Telecommunications and Information Administration, *Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program*, Notice of Funding Opportunity, pp. 64-65, available at https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/sites/default/files/ 2022-05/BEAD%20NOFO.pdf.

        "text": "*The Persistent Broadband Digital Divide: Selected Deployment Issues and Considerations* projects targeted at unserved areas.71  In response to the proposed RDOF, in 2019, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission urged the FCC to prioritize unserved areas.72 A provision to connect areas unserved by broadband was proposed in the 117th Congress in the Connect Unserved Americans Act of 2022 (S. 3587/H.R. 7060).  Among other things, the bill would have increased the percentage (from 50% to 80%) of rural households that a project must serve to receive a grant or loan through the Rural Utilities Service\u2019s Distance Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband program.  Congress may weigh which aspect/definition of the digital divide it wishes to prioritize\u2014whether to prioritize funding for areas without 25/3 Mbps broadband ahead of funding upgrades of existing 25/3 Mbps networks to faster speeds.  Congress may also take population density and number of connections into account\u2014for example, should Congress prioritize federal funds that might connect thousands of households in an area versus hundreds of households in an area.  **Applying Tools from Rural Electrification and Limitations on Cooperatives and Municipalities** How to connect rural areas to services has faced the United States in the past in the context of electricity.  According to the USDA, \u201cin 1936, nearly 90% of farms lacked electric power because the costs to get electricity to rural areas were prohibitive. \u201d73 Similar to broadband deployment, \u201crunning wires into the countryside where there might be only a few people per square mile seemed uneconomical for either investors or taxpayers. \u201d74 In response, the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (REA; P.L. 74-605) was enacted, which allowed the federal government to make low-cost loans to non-profit cooperatives.75  The REA helped bring electricity to rural areas, as by 1950, nearly 80% of U.S. farms had electric service.76  Some policymakers have drawn parallels between rural electrification and rural broadband deployment, arguing \u201cthat something similar \\\\[to rural electrification\\\\] needs to happen to create widespread changes to the issue of rural internet availability. \u201d77 For example, according to a 2018 statement by FCC Chairwoman (then Commissioner) Rosenworcel, \u201cWe were able to get 71 Letter from Senators Steve Daines, Charles E.

It is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, to accelerate precision agriculture, to participate equally in school learning and health care, and to stay connected. \u201d79 Cooperatives80 played the main role in rural electrification.  Similar to broadband, \u201cpower companies thought rural America too spacious and sparsely populated to provide the necessary returns on investment. \u201d81 Similarly, \u201cthere has been a growing trend among electric cooperatives, which electrified these same rural parts of the country in the 1930s and 1940s, to do it again for broadband. \u201d82 According to Pew Charitable Trusts, \u201cA key challenge for electric cooperatives seeking to provide broadband services is securing funding or financing for deployment.  Because they do not have as much capital as traditional internet service providers, cooperatives often turn to state and federal programs for additional funding for these projects. \u201d83 Cooperatives may have difficulties in accessing federal funding for broadband.  According to NTIA\u2019s BroadbandUSA federal funding site, out of over 90 programs, cooperatives may potentially be eligible for 15 funding opportunities.  Among these is the USDA\u2019s ReConnect program, which offers loans, grants, and loan-grant combinations for broadband deployment in rural areas.84  A consideration for Congress may be whether to expand eligibility criteria for cooperatives for other federal broadband programs or whether to create a new broadband program that prioritizes cooperatives as eligible recipients.  Municipal broadband is another avenue Congress could potentially look to in filling rural broadband gaps.  Some public entities, such as municipal governments, have stepped in to provide broadband services to areas unserved by private sector providers.  A patchwork of state laws on municipal broadband exist, with 28 states allowing municipalities to deploy broadband and 22 states either explicitly prohibiting it or having regulations that could make establishing municipal broadband networks challenging.  As one of many various options, Congress could weigh granting the FCC explicit authority to preempt state laws to remove potential barriers to municipal 78 Marguerite Reardon, \u201cFCC Leaders Say We Need a \u2018National Mission\u2019 to Fix Rural Broadband,\u201d CNET, October 24, 2018, available at https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/fcc-leaders-say-we-need-a-national-mission-to- fix-rural-broadband/.  79 The White House, *FACT SHEET: Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework Creates Economic Opportunities for Rural America*, July 8, 2021, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/08/fact- sheet-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework-creates-economic-opportunities-for-rural-america/. 80 According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, \u201cElectrical cooperatives are private, nonprofit organizations that provide electricity to customers in their service areas.
