The FCC established the fund in 1997 in compliance with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Originally designed to subsidize telephone service, since 2011 the fund has expanded its goals to supporting broadband universal service. The Universal Service Fund's budget ranges from $5\u20138 billion per year depending on the needs of the telecommunications providers. These needs include the cost to maintain the hardware needed for their services and the services themselves. In 2022 disbursements totaled $7.4 billion, split across the USF's four main programs: $2.1 billion for the E-rate program, $4.2 billion for the high-cost program, $0.6 billion for the Lifeline program, and $0.5 billion for the rural health care program.:\u200a4\u200a\nUnlike many government programs which are funded by general Congressional appropriations, the Universal Service Fund is instead funded by a specific fee on United States telephone providers. While separate itemization is not required by the FCC, it is common for USF fees to be listed separately from other charges on a consumer's bill. As of 2024, the rate for the USF budget was 34.4% of a telecom company's interstate and international end-user revenues.\nThe structure and funding of the USF has been subject to significant criticism and proposed reforms. One issue is a declining revenue base: consumers' spending on the interstate telephone service that funds the USF has been falling for many years. Some have challenged the constitutionality of having USF fees set without congressional approval and the delegation of authority to the private USAC.\n\nBackground\nIn the modern sense of offering service to all people, the promotion of universal service in telecommunications was crystalized in the 1960s. Some sources point to the earlier Communications Act of 1934 as promoting universal service based on the language of its preamble, but other historians have pointed out that in the early 20th century \"universal service\" was originally an AT&T marketing slogan about telephone interconnection, not evolving into a legal mandate to serve every American until much later.\n\nImplicit subsidies for local service (1970-1982)\nIn the 1960s the telecommunication monopolies were shocked by new evolving technologies and competitions: new long-distance carriers and microwave networks were authorized. Companies such as MCI Communications began to offer long-distance service in direction competition to AT&T. With falling costs on long-distance service, regulators decided to reallocate the increasing profit on long-distance telecommunication to fund subsidies to make local telephone connection more affordable. This process began in the mid 1960 and was institutionalized through the Ozark plan of 1970 into action. At the time of the institutionalization telephone penetration ranged between 85 and 95%. There has been some dispute about whether the charges paid from long distance service to local carriers were a subsidy or not.\nLegally, jurisdiction to regulate rates was split between the Federal Communications Comision (international and interstate) and state commissions (intrastate). During the 91st congress, Fred B. Rooney introduced H.R. 12150 creating a joint board between the Federal Communications Commission and the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners to clearly delineate how telephone regulation was separated by jurisdiction. The joint board met on a voluntary basis and authored the Ozark plan. The situation was then formalized when the bill was reintroduced in the next congress as H.R. 7048 The Federal-State Commissions Joint Board Act and passed into law in 1971.\n\nBreakup of the Bell system (1982-1996)\nThere was a push for deregulating the telecommunications industry in the 1980s. Under President Ronald Reagan, the FCC shifted its focus from \"social equity to an economic efficiency objective,\" which it claimed was a primary purpose of the Communications Act of 1934. After AT&T was split up in 1984, universal service was still \"supported by a system of above-cost access charges paid to local exchange companies.\" This system was administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association.\n\nHistory\nTelecommunications Act of 1996\nThe Universal Service Fund was first codified in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the first major rewrite of the Communications Act of 1934. The act addresses new challenges and opportunities of the digital information age, with the goal of promoting an economic environment conducive for the growth of new information technology. It also further developed the meaning and implementation of universal service. The act calls for the creation of a joint federal-state board to make recommendations to the FCC on defining federal universal services and set time tables. The act also set out immediate priorities of universal service. These include quality and reasonably priced services, access to advanced telecommunication services, access for rural, low-income and high-cost regions, equitable and nondiscriminatory service, specific and predictable price structure, access of advanced telecommunication services for schools and health care and libraries (Sec. 254(b)(1)-(7)). The act provided ability in the constantly changing telecommunication environment to periodically revisit and adjust universal service, while setting core principles (Sec. 254(c)). The 1996 act also \"mandated the creation of the universal service fund (USF) into which all telecommunications providers are required to contribute a percentage of their interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues\".\nIncreased competition and universal service were legislatively addressed and codified with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The major goals of Universal Service as mandated by the 1996 Act are as follows:\n\nPromote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable and affordable rates for all consumers\nIncrease nationwide access to advanced telecommunications services\nAdvance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas, at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas\nIncrease access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities\nProvide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs\nThe 1996 Act states that all providers of telecommunications services should contribute to federal universal service in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner; there should be specific, predictable, and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service; all schools, classrooms, health care providers, and libraries should, generally, have access to advanced telecommunications services; and finally, that the Federal-State Joint Board and the FCC should determine those other principles that, consistent with the 1996 Act, are necessary to protect the public interest.\nIn the past, only long-distance companies made contributions to support the federal Universal Service Fund. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded the types of companies contributing to the Universal Service Fund.\n\nExpansion to Voice Over IP services\nSince the USF fees were originally designed to cover \"telecommunications services\", voice over IP services which run over the internet were initially not subject to USF fees. Critics argued this avoidance of USF fees helped make the fund unsustainable. In June 2006, the FCC voted to require providers of VoIP services to contribute to the Universal Service Fund the same way traditional telephone services had been contributing.\nAfter the 2018 USF changes, VoIP service providers are now required to provide funds for the USF. However, they are exempt from the cost of using the Internet for information transport whereas DSL internet providers and modern cable services must burden the cost. This expands cost distortion to long-distance telephone providers and it raises the cost of telecommunications service for more consumers.\n\nExpansion of the fund into broadband\nThe concept of universal service may include other telecommunications-information services, mainly Internet access.\nMany of the services covered by the USF are related to traditional telephone technology. There is a rising concern that more recent developments in telecommunications are just as important to the consumer as these older technologies. For example, consumers' subscriptions to traditional telephone services have fallen while their subscription rate to wireless services have been rising consistently. Yet many cellular companies are likely to receive less funding under the new rules, which may reduce consumers' access to wireless services in areas of the country that have low populations. Similarly, a question currently debated is whether access to broadband internet should be supported by the USF and if so, how best to fulfill such a large mandate without damaging the stability of the fund. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 states that \"advanced services\" should be accessible to all Americans [Section 254(b)(3)]. One question is whether the providers of internet access should contribute to the fund like other companies that provide access to telecommunications, if such providers also want to draw from the fund. Supporters of including internet access in the Universal Service Fund include former Congressman Rick Boucher (D-VA)\nAdding additional services to the fund has corporate support from major telecommunication companies, including Verizon and AT&T. In March 2009, senior executives from Verizon Communications met with the House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet, providing recommendations for how best to proceed bringing broadband and mobile communication access to rural and unserved areas. Citing reform to the Universal Service Fund as a means \"to better serve rural America,\" Verizon recommended that a limit be set on the size of USF's high-cost fund, competitive bidding wars be employed to determine which company expand service to unserved areas, structure a \"wire-center approach\" model to replace statewide cost averaging, restructure how contributions to the USF are determined, and impose a deadline on the FCC for completion of their reform of inter-carrier compensation.\nUnions such as the Communications Workers of America also endorsed the expansion the Unviersal Service Fund into supporting broadband.\nOn the other hand, discussions continued over whether the USF should be used to provide services such as broadband internet access. Plans to subsidize internet service providers has led to backlash from traditional telecommunications carriers. Traditional carriers argue that \u201cthe relevant provisions of the 1996 Act do not give the FCC carte blanche to play regulatory Robin Hood with their universal service contributions.\u201d \nIn October 2011 the FCC formally proposed a \"Connect America Fund\" to address these and other concerns. Reform finally arrived on October 27, 2011, when the FCC approved a six-year transfer process that would transition money from the Universal Service Fund to a new $4.5 billion a year Connect America Fund that will support the expansion of broadband services to areas that don't have broadband access yet.\n\nRecent history (2014-present)\nIn May 2018, the FCC moved $8 billion from a private bank to the US Treasury. This anticipated move caused an uproar from FCC Democratic commissioners who were concerned about the money being allocated to large corporations instead of the citizens. FCC commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel stated that this move \"sacrificed $50 million in annual interest that could have been used to support rural broadband, telemedicine & internet in schools.\" Although lawmakers and commissioners claimed that this move was unexpected, there was a letter previously written to the General Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2018 asking for a review on the plan to review the funds. The GAO claimed that the USF funds are not regulated as intensively as other government funds, so this move was an attempt to \"improve management and oversight of the funds.\"\nOn May 21, 2018, the FCC issued an order that prohibited USF programs from buying equipment from Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE. These companies are considered a risk to national security by American intelligence agencies. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow commented that the Trump Administration are \u00a8aware of security issues, sanctions issues, technology theft issues, et cetera.\u00a8\n\nComponents\nHigh Cost\nThe largest and most complex of the four programs, the high cost program subsidizes telecommunications services in rural and remote areas which are more expensive to connect to networks. The program paid out $4.2 billion in subsidies to telecommunications companies in 2022,:\u200a20\u200a with a goal of making telecommunications affordable to rural and remote areas. The program has been criticized as wasteful, granting large sums of money to telecommunications companies while having little effect on access.\nTo determine eligibility for the high-cost program, each US state is broken into geographically into one or more study areas. A study area is defined by each study area's incumbent local exchange carrier, the modern successor of the local telephone monopoly. Incumbent local exchange carriers are sub-classified into those that operate on rate-of-return (ROR) model, and those subject to price caps (PC).\nAccording to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, in order to be eligible for USF support, carriers must be legally designated as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) and take on a legal obligation to serve everyone in a particular area. State utility commissions are primarily responsible for defining both the number of eligible telecommunications carriers and the areas that they must serve.\n\nDuring the time of the Bell system and up through the 1980s, the traditional business model for an incumbent local exchange carrier was operating as a rate-of-return (ROR) carrier. These companies operated as regulated monopolies with profits limited to set percentage of total investment. As of 2019, companies that continue to operate as rate-of-return carriers are generally small, rural carriers serving 5% or less of households in the United States. About $2.5 billion in high-cost support goes to these rate-of-return carriers. Rate-of-return companies have two options for how to receive high-cost funds. First, they can opt for the traditional cost-accounting mechanism, under which the high cost will reimburse the company for their deployment costs plus an additional 10.25% return on investment. Alternatively, rate-of-return companies can choose model-based support, where costs are estimated in advance. The type of subsidy across rate-of-return study areas is split between the two support mechanisms, with about 40% of rate-of-return study areas operating under the traditional mechanism and 60% opting for model-based support.\nIn response to the criticism of the rate-of-return model, the FCC made efforts to encourage carriers to voluntarily move to a price cap (PC) approach. Beginning in 1990, the FCC began applying a Price Cap approach under which local exchange carriers would be allowed to adjust rates within the price cap without lengthy regulatory filings and deliberation.\n\nTelephone funds\nFrom 1998 to 2009, the high-cost fund supported the programs detailed below, which are aimed at telephone service. With the advent of the Connect America Fund, most of these programs have been phased out.\nLegacy High cost programs:\n\nHigh Cost Loop Support (HCLS) - The longest running High Cost fund. According to the benchmark established in 1988, telephone companies with fixed costs of more than 115% of the national average would have 65% of excess costs covered, and fixed costs above 150% of the national average would receive a 75% subsidy. In dollar terms high cost loop support grew from $56 million in 1986 to $1.47 billion in 2010. Historically available to all telephone carriers, the fund's eligibility was later narrowed to rural telephone carriers. Safety Valve Support (SVS) is a supplement to HCLS. Safety Net Additive Support (SNAS) is another former supplement to HCLS.\nHigh Cost Model Support (HCMS) - Another former program.\nLocal Switching Support (LSS) - Another former program.\nLong Term Support (LTS) - Another former program, ended in July 2004 and replaced by the ICLS.\nInterstate Common Line Support (ICLS) - Another former legacy High Cost fund going to rate-of-return carriers. For rate-of return carriers, costs to maintain infrastructure between the consumer and the local exchange are assumed to be 25% intrastate and 75% interstate. If federal subscriber line charges (SLC) and the bills paid by customers do not cover the companies' interstate common line costs, the ICLS will make up the difference. This original fund covered telephone service, but in practice covered infrastructure that could often also be used for broadband. As originally formulated, the fund could not be used for broadband-only service. Then in 2016 subsidies were expanded to also include broadband-only service, and renamed the Connect America Fund Broadband Loop Support (CAF BLS).\nInterstate Access Support (IAS) - Another former program, analogous to ICLS, but for Price Cap Carriers.\n\nConnect America Fund\nAs part of the National Broadband Plan proposed in March 2010, the FCC proposed reorganizing the High Cost program into a new \"Connect America Fund\", which will include both voice and 4 Mbit/s internet connectivity. On October 27, 2011, the FCC approved a six-year transfer process that would transition the money from the Universal Service Fund High-Cost Program into the new $4.5 billion a year Connect America Fund, effectively putting an end to the USF High-Cost Fund by 2018.\nPost-2010 High cost programs:\n\nFrozen High Cost Support (FHCS) - After the announcement of the Connect America Fund, the existing subsidies to Price Cap Carriers and to Competitive Local Exchange Carriers was frozen at 2011 levels.\nIntercarrier Compensation Recovery (ICC) - Another legacy High Cost fund. In 2011, the FCC announced its intention to gradually move intercarrier compensation to a Bill and keep model. Traditionally, local exchange carriers would charge other carriers for calls terminating through their network. The ICC was set up to partially replace the revenue that local exchange carriers previously collected from intercarrier compensation.\nConnect America Fund, Phase I Incremental Support - This program, also known simply as Incremental Support was a program aimed at accelerating broadband deployment active from 2012 to 2014. In 2012, during \"Phase I\" of the Connect America Fund, $115 million in subsidies were given out to build out broadband in 37 states, with $71.9 million going to Frontier Communications and $35 million to Century Link, with AT&T and Verizon declining to participate. In 2013, also during \"Phase I\", CenturyLink accepted another $54 million, and AT&T accepted $100 million.\nConnect America Fund Phase II Model - In March 2014, the FCC approved \"Connect America Fund Phase II Model\", moving $1.8 billion a year in funding from telephone subsidies to broadband, and clarifying the specifics of the funding process. Under the framework the FCC approved, incumbent carriers have priority access to subsidies, but if the funds are declined, the funds are allocated by a competitive bidding process. The FCC also proposed upping the minimum speed requirement from 4 Mbit/s to 10 Mbit/s. In May 2014, the 10th circuit court of appeals upheld the shift in funds in the face of a legal challenge by telephone companies.\nConnect America Fund Broadband Loop Support (CAF BLS) - Rate-of-return carriers that did elect to adopt ACAM II support were moved to the legacy mechanism CAF BLS.\nConnect America Fund Phase II Auction (CAFII Auc) - In 2018, the FCC conducted an auction awarding 103 companies a total of $1.49 billion over 10 years. This included all areas which were not covered by the previous Connect America Fund Phase II Model.\nAlternative Connect America Model (ACAM)/Revised Alternative Connect America Model (Revised ACAM) - In March 2016, the FCC unanimously voted to provide $20 billion over the next 10 years in \"support for small carriers.\" The FCC will be offering the fund $20 billion over the next 10 years to support service in \"high cost areas.\" This reform is a modernization of the program support of broadband in \"high cost areas.\" It will target communities that most need support. The reform is made up of three main elements: \"Modernizes Existing Universal Service Program for Rate-of-Return Carriers\", \"Create Two Paths to a 'Connect America Fund' for Rate-of Return Carriers\" and \"Increase Fiscal Responsibility in the Universal Service Fund.\"\nAlternative Connect America Model II (ACAM II)\nEnhanced Alternative Connect America Model (Enhanced ACAM) - In 2023 the FCC created this program for Rate-of-Return carriers to transition away from ACAM, Revised ACAM, ACAM II, and CAF BLS.\nAlaska Plan (AK Plan) - In 2016, the FCC established the Alaska plan, which offers fixed support of $150 million a year for 10 years (2017-2026), for $1.5 billion total to extend 10/1 Mbps broadband service to high cost areas in Alaska.\nUniendo a Puerto Rico Fund/Connect USVI Fund consists of several programs specifically for the Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands: Bringing Puerto Rico Together Fixed Support (PR Fixed), Bringing Puerto Rico Together Mobile Support (PR Mobile), United States Virgin Islands Fixed Support (USVI Fixed), and United States Virgin Islands Mobile Support (USVI Mobile).\nRural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) - In 2020, the FCC announced $9.2 billion in funding to build rural broadband networks. Recipients included LTD Broadband at $1.1 billion and SpaceX's Starlink at $885 million. LTD won bids to build broadband in 15 states, but was had its application to be designated an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier rejected in 6 of those states, due to doubts about its ability to complete the buildout. The FCC later withdrew the RDOF funding for both LTD and Starlink.\nRural Broadband Experiments (RBE)\nMobility Fund Phase I - The Connect America Fund also included the Mobility Fund, which is given to wireless carriers who expand service to underserved areas. \"Phase I\" of the Mobility Fund offered $300 million for a September 2012 round of auctions, and \"Phase II\" of the Mobility Fund plans to give out $500 million in annual support.\n\nSummary\n\u2020 Programs marked with a dagger symbol were funded from the High Cost account, so do not appear in the total funding projection.\n\nProposed High Cost programs\nSome programs have been proposed, but not yet implemented.\n\nMobility Fund Phase II - In 2017, new FCC chairman Ajit Varadaraj Pai promoted this fund as a way to expand 4G broadband access to rural areas. He wanted to bridge \"the digital divide between rural and urban areas\" by working on \"expanding broadband options\". Pai believes that there is waste occurring between the private and public sectors as private capital is already being given to areas in order to build out networks. However, some of these areas are still being subsidized. Pai intends to make sure that broadband accessibility is included in an infrastructure bill to come. The proposed program for $4.53 billion over 10 years, but was canceled in favor of the 5G Fund for Rural America.\n5G Fund for Rural America (5G Fund) - A planned fund to build out 5G wireless service via a reverse auction.\n\nLow income (Lifeline)\nSince 1985, the Lifeline program has provided subsidies to low-income people to pay for phone service; first landlines, then cellphones, and as of 2016 it also offers the option of Internet connectivity. It provides a subsidy of up to $9.25 a month for Americans below 135% of the poverty line. Residents of Native American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities may qualify for enhanced Lifeline assistance (up to an additional $25.00). The Lifeline program is limited to one discount per household. A \"household\" includes anyone living at the same address \"who share income(s) and household expenses\".\nThe Lifeline program has been subject to scrutiny and debate over the scope of the program. Issues include instituting checks for income eligibility and duplicate applications, whether the program should support broadband, whether the program should have a budget cap.\n\nRural health care\nThe Rural Health Care Support program \"provides funding to eligible health care providers (HCPs) for telecommunications and broadband services necessary for the provision of health care.\"\nThe rural health care program provides subsidies to health care providers for telehealth and telemedicine services, typically by a combination of video-conferencing infrastructure and high speed Internet access, to enable doctors and patients in rural hospitals to access specialists in distant cities at affordable rates. The Rural Health Care Support Mechanism allows rural health care providers to pay rates for telecommunications services similar to those of their urban counterparts, making telehealth services affordable. Over $417 million has been allocated for the construction of 62 statewide or regional broadband telehealth networks in 42 states and three U.S. territories under the Rural Health Care Pilot Program. In 2022, the rural health care program paid out $488 million.:\u200a20\u200a\nThere are three components of the Rural Health Care Program: Telecommunications Program, HCF Program, Pilot Program.\n\"The Telecommunications Program (formerly known as the Primary Program) provides discounts for telecommunications services for eligible health care providers (HCPs).\"\n\"The Healthcare Connect Fund (HCF) Program is the newest component of the Rural Health Care Program. The HCF Program will provide a 65 percent discount on eligible expenses related to broadband connectivity to both individual rural health care providers (HCPs) and consortia, which can include non-rural HCPs (if the consortium has a majority of rural sites).\"\n\"The Pilot Program provides funding for up to 85 percent of eligible costs of the construction or implementation of statewide and/or regional broadband networks. There are 50 active projects involving hundreds of health care providers (HCPs).\"\n\nSchools and Libraries Program (E-Rate)\nThe E-Rate program provides subsidies for Internet access and general telecommunications services to schools and libraries. The subsidies typically pay 20% to 90% of costs based on need, with rural and low-income schools receiving the greatest subsidy. In 2022, the E-Rate program paid out $2.1 billion. Every year since 2010, the Wireline Competition Bureau announces the funding cap for the E-Rate program to adhere to the current needs of schools and libraries telecommunications.\n\"The Eligible Services List (ESL) for each funding year provides guidance on the eligibility of products and services under the Schools and Libraries Program.\" In 2015, USAC outlined two specific categories for grouping the ESL, and one category for miscellaneous services.\n\n\"Category One\nData Transmission Services and Internet Access, and Voice Services\nCategory two\nInternal Connections, Managed Internal Broadband Services, and Basic Maintenance of Internal Connections\nMiscellaneous\"\nStarting in the 2011 funding year, the different types of schools eligible to receive benefits now include:\n\n\"School on Tribal lands\nSchools that serve children with physical, cognitive, and behavioral disabilities\nSchools that serve children with medical needs\nJuvenile justice schools, where eligible\nSchools with 35 percent or more students eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).\"\n\nAdministration\nUniversal Service Administrative Company\nFollowing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the subsequent creation of the Universal Service Fund, the FCC designated the independent American nonprofit corporation named the \"Universal Service Administrative Company\" to manage the contribution of revenue to and distribution of funding from the Universal Service Fund. The Schools and Libraries Corporation and the Rural Health Care Corporation were merged into the USAC on January 1, 1999. The USAC is a fully owned legal subsidiary of the National Exchange Carrier Association, but is governed by a separate 20-person board of directors serving 3 year terms representing various stakeholder interests.\nUSAC reports quarterly revenue projections detailing what contributions are expected and detailing what actions are taken in the expansion and bolstering of universal service. The USAC receives contributions from all companies providing interstate and international telephone and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service. Contributors send payments based on projected quarterly earnings. The FCC does not require companies to charge their customers for these contributions \u2013 this funding decision is left up to the individual companies. This revenue is deposited into a central fund, from which the USAC distributes money to the four central services at the core of the USF: High Cost, Low Income, Schools and Libraries, and Rural Health Care.\n\"The USAC collects revenue data from USF contributors on the FCC Form 499-A (Annual Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet) and FCC Form 499-Q (Quarterly Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet).\" The USAC is responsible for estimating how much money is needed for the USF program. The USAC provides a \"demand filing,\" to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) each quarter in its FCC Filings.\nWhile the USAC cannot act without Congressional approval, it can make recommendations. USAC recommendations have resulted in expanding telecommunication resources, particularly broadband Internet and mobile access to schools and libraries, and recognizing VoIP as a form of interstate and international communication, which requires those companies providing VoIP services to contribute to the USF.\n\nFederal Communications Commission\nThe FCC oversees the USAC's administration of the Universal Service Fund, and institutes reforms as it sees fit. Although the fund is limited by the scope of US law, (mainly the 1996 Telecommunications Act)\nthe FCC has played a part in making several changes to the fund, including shifting funds from the high cost program towards broadband expansion. Under the FCC, there is an Enforcement Bureau that investigates and pursues the violators of the Act of 1996 and any Commissions rules.\n\nNational Exchange Carrier Association\nThe National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) collects rate-of-return carrier cost data, does initial validation, and calculates how much funding carriers are eligible for and forwards all this information to the USAC.\nThe NECA is also the legal parent of the USAC, but maintains a separate board.\n\nFederal-state joint boards\nBeginning in the 1980s, the Federal-State Joint Board on Jurisdictional Separations made recommendations for the establishment of a universal service fund. They issued Monitoring Reports overseeing the early Universal Service fund from 1987 to 1997.\nThe Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service was established in March 1996 to make recommendations on the implementation of the universal service provisions of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. This board has taken over preparing Monitoring Reports concerning the Universal Service Fund.\n\nFunding\nCurrently, all telecommunications companies that provide service between states, including long-distance companies, local telephone companies, wireless telephone companies, paging companies, and payphone providers, are legally required to contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund. Carriers providing international services also must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. These providers contribute to the fund \"based on their interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues.\" On a quarterly basis, the Universal Service Administrative Company submits projected demand for Universal Service funding and projected contribution base to the Federal Communications Commission Office of Managing Director (OMD). There is then a 14-day public review, after which the rate is finalized. As of the third quarter of 2024, telecommunication companies were required to contribute 34.4% of their interstate revenue to the fund.\nWhile many providers bundle phone calls within a state (intrastate), calls between states (interstate), and calls to between countries (international) into a single monthly fee, the USF fee does not apply to revenue generated from calls within a single state. Therefore, phone companies apply the USF fee only to the interstate and international revenue. To accomplish this, they can opt to apply the USF fee to the \"safe-harbor percentage\" of assumed interstate revenue (64.9% for VoIP, 37.1% for cellular service). Alternatively, companies can conduct a traffic study demonstrating the percentage of interstate usage (PIU) and submit it to the Universal Service Administrative Company.\nWhile not required to do so, most telephone companies bill their customers with a separate line item for the USF fee. The contributions are collected by the Universal Service Administrative Company and disbursed towards four programs that the federal USF supports, as directed by the FCC. Universal Service charges should not be confused with what are sometimes referred to in telephone company bills as \"Federal Subscriber Line\" charges, which are access fees charged by telecommunications companies, not the local or federal government.\n\nDeclining revenues\nThe rapidly changing interstate and international telecommunications markets can quickly and unpredictably bring about changes in USF funding levels. Dorothy Attwood of the FCC Wireline Competition Bureau stated, \"One striking development that we've witnessed in the interstate marketplace is the steady decline of interstate revenues. Although traditional long-distance revenues grew consistently between 1984 and 1997, they're now in a period of steady decline\". She pointed out that competition in the interstate long-distance market, wireless substitution, and bundling of service packages that blur traditional service categories are all reducing revenues that serve to finance the USF. Service providers simply transferred the cost to customers in the form of a long-distance surcharge to make up for reduced revenue. While the expenditures of the USF have increased since its inception, in part due to expansion of support paid to competitive providers, the revenues on which contributions are made \u2013 interstate and international telecommunications revenues \u2013 have become increasingly more difficult for contributors to identify as a result of evolution of services offered. Overall revenues reported by telecommunications companies have steadily increased, if information service revenues are included. However, the revenues for these services are no longer subject to contribution.\nSome have raised concerns about the future funding of the USF; despite falling taxable revenues, the size of the fund has increased from $1.2 billion in collections at 5.7% in 4Q 2000, to $2.2 billion in 4Q 2014 at 16.1%.\n\nState universal service funds\nMany US States have their own universal service funds, with budget and administration independent of the much larger federal fund. States with their own programs may have their own eligibility guidelines. As of 2019, 42 states had universal service funds in addition to the federal program, totaling $1.7 billion in disbursements in 2017. Those without state funds consisted of Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Virginia.\nTo support the state programs, many states impose a fee on intrasate calling revenue (the portion not falling under the federal USF fee).\n\nWaste and fraud\nThe issue of waste and fraud, as with many government programs, has been addressed as well. Gilroy stated, \"The ability to ensure that only eligible services are funded, that funding is disbursed at the proper level of discount, that alleged services have been received, and the integrity of the competitive bidding process is upheld have been questioned\". Improved auditing of particularly the E-rate program has been addressed.\nThere have been multiple cases of waste and fraud throughout disbursement of subsidies from the Universal Service Fund. There is some concern on the lag time between application, approval, and actual receipt of funds. In terms of fraud, some school officials have been bribed by contractors working with corporations so that they use subsidies to purchase computer equipment from said corporation. In addition, some beneficiaries inaccurately report costs to inflate their subsidies amount. In terms of waste, some equipment subsidized by the USF has been left unused for several years.\nAn investigation into potential fraud in 2004 revealed that contractors working with Hewlett-Packard bribed school officials. Hewlett-Packard wanted the schools to use subsidies provided by the fund to purchase computer equipment from Hewlett-Packard. The second example of fraud was when \"Sandwich Isles Communication purposely inflated and inaccurately reported money to receive inflated subsidies.\"\nCritics continue to raise concerns in regards to the wastefulness of the fund. For example, \"$5 million worth of equipment purchased by Chicago public schools with E-rate funds was left unused in a warehouse for years.\" Lastly, a problem that has plagued the program is the long lag time between the overall application of the programs and the approval.\nThe USF has some issues in dealing with insufficient controls over determining who qualifies for funding, and limited auditing practices that are supposed to ensure that telecommunication companies are not overpaying or underpaying their dues to the fund.\nThe USF is able to reward those living in rural or impoverished areas who are capable of paying the entire cost of personal telecommunication services. Critics argue that inconsistent and asymmetrical audits allow for wealthy consumers to avoid triggering some USF financial burdens. Wealthy landowners in rural estates decide to utilize USF subsidies and pay a fraction of what they can realistically afford.\nCritics note that reimbursing carriers on a \u201c\u2018cost-plus\u2019 basis\u201d creates \u201cincentives to increase rather than decreas[e] costs\u201d By reimbursing \u201ccarriers for the full cost of infrastructure development plus 11.25 percent of those costs in profit,\u201d the fund may expose itself to exploitation.\n\nProposed changes\nDebate over the Universal Service Fund has consistently involved the scope of the funding, which technology types and companies should fund the program, which groups should be eligible for benefits, and the need to clean up waste and fraud in the program.\n\nLegislative bills\nA draft proposal of the Telecommunications Act of 2005 was the subject of hearings in Congress. The proposal outlined a significant restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, ultimately the House of Representatives passed a bill, the Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Enhancement Act of 2006 (COPE \u2013 H.R.5252.RS, S. 2686). The bill was sent from the House to the Senate, where subsequent readings left it awaiting a legislative action. Under the proposed restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, greater emphasis on the wide availability of broadband and mobile access would be considered. Additionally, consideration of revenue contribution to the Universal Service Fund would be radically revised, given that the creation of obligatory broadband and mobile communication access would require a wide range of broadband, mobile, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service providers to contribute a portion of their revenue to the fund. Lastly, the Act urged an FCC consideration of the universal service structure. The bill was not passed.\nIn January 2007, Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) sponsored a bill (the Universal Service for Americans Act, S. 101) that would increase universal service tax base to include broadband ISPs and VoIP providers, to fund broadband deployment in rural and low-income regions of the country. This bill was referred to committee, but as no further action was taken on it by the 110th Congress, the bill never became law.\nOn February 13, 2009, Congressman Bob Latta (R-OH) introduced H.Res. 176 which states that, \"in order to continue aggressive growth in our Nation's telecommunications and technology industries, the United States Government should 'Get Out of the Way and Stay Out of the Way'.\" The bill died in committee.\nOn July 22, 2010, the Universal Service Reform Act of 2010 was introduced by Representatives Boucher (D-Va) and Terry (R-NE). The measure is intended to improve and modernize the USF by reining in the size of the fund and promoting broadband deployment.\nOn July 2, 2021 the Funding Affordable Internet with Reliable (FAIR) Contributions Act (S. 2427) was introduced by Roger Wicker (R-MS) to study the possibility of collecting USF contributions from edge providers. Wicker reintroduced the bill in the 118th congress (S. 856). The bill was endorsed by United States Telecom Association and NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association.\nOn November 15, 2023 the Lowering Broadband Costs for Consumers Act of 2023 (S. 3321) was introduced by Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) to require internet service providers and edge providers to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The bill was supported by the United States Telecom Association and NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association.\nOn May 1, 2024 the Promoting Affordable Connectivity Act (S. 4208) was introduced by John Fetterman (D-PA) to permanently extend the Affordable Connectivity Program by merging it into the USF and requiring internet service providers and edge providers to pay into the USF.\n\nChanges to funding sources\nProposals have been made to increase the number of sources from which universal service fund is collected. Suggestions include requiring additional companies pay into the USF such internet service providers, large technology companies, including intrastate telephone services (calls within single states), or increasing contribution requirements from wireless communication providers.\nAlternatively, there have also been suggestions to move all funding to regular congressional appropriations.\n\nCapping expenditures\nIn 2019, the FCC considered instituting a spending cap on the USF fund. The measure was supported by some groups, such as the Technology Policy Institute. On the other hand the proposed cap was criticised by Ron Wyden among other US Senators.\n\nClassification of internet service providers\nOver the years, disputes about legal classification of internet service providers as either common carriers or information services has had implications for the Universal Service fund, as the FCC has stronger legal authority to regulate common carriers.\nAround 2014, there was discussion about reclassifying broadband under Title II of the 1996 Telecommunications Act so the FCC would have the authority to enforce Net Neutrality.  Opponents of the move argued that this reclassification eventually be followed by requiring ISPs to pay into the USF as a new source of revenue for the fund. The FCC has made clear that the change does give it the power to do so, but will not require contributions on broadband Internet access revenues at this time, as the FCC will forbear from the contribution requirements in Section 254(d) of the Communications Act.\nIn 2017, the FCC reversed its decision and reclassified ISPs as information services. Then in 2013, the FCC changed once again classified ISPs under Title II. The FCC has continued to exempt broadband providers from Universal Service fund fees, but groups such as NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association continue to push for USF fees to be expanded to ISPs.\n\nCourt cases\nSome telecommunications policy experts strongly dispute the delegation of authority to the USAC, arguing that the FCC ignores challenges to USAC policy from telephone carriers for fear that either an explicit endorsement or rejection would open up the FCC to lawsuits.\nBecause ISP's and traditional telecommunications carriers often provide similar services, the USF may \u201cviolate[] the pro-competitive precepts of the 1996 Act.\" These concerns and others, as well as longstanding opposition to the Universal Service Fund from government watchdogs and fiscal conservatives, inspired litigation in 2023 arguing that the fund violates the U.S. Constitution. The firm Consumers' Research filed lawsuits in the 5th, 6th, and 11th circuits. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals first ruled in Consumers\u2019 Research v. Federal Communications Commission that the fund is constitutional, but that ruling has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.  In the mean time, the Fifth Circuit has ruled that it is unconstitutional. This combination of rulings on legality of the USF has resulted in a circuit split. The Supreme Court accepted two petitions for review from Consumers' Research's cases, consolidating them into one case, FCC v. Consumers' Research, to be heard during its 2024-2025 term.\nIn 2008, Todd Heath sued Wisconsin Bell for overcharging schools and libraries beyond the \"lowest corresponding price\" required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In the 2025 case Wisconsin Bell, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Heath, the Supreme Court ruled that because E-Rate program is partially funded by government contributions, such overcharges can be prosecuted under the False Claims Act of 1863.\n\nSee also\nE-Rate\nNational broadband plans from around the world\nRural electrification\nNational Exchange Carrier Association\n\nReferences\nFederal Communications Commission\nUniversal Service Administrative Company\nExternal links\nFCC website\nUniversal Access (Free Press)\nUniversal Service Administrative Company\nAbout the USAC Archived January 2, 2014, at the Wayback Machine\nSchools & Libraries\nHigh Cost\nLow Income\nRural Healthcare\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\nLifelineSupport.org - official page for info on the program\nLifeline National Verifier - official page for verifying eligibility", "summary": "The Universal Service Fund (USF) is a system of telecommunications subsidies and fees managed by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to promote universal access to telecommunications services in the United States. The FCC established the fund in 1997 in compliance with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Originally designed to subsidize telephone service, since 2011 the fund has expanded its goals to supporting broadband universal service. The Universal Service Fund's budget ranges from $5\u20138 billion per year depending on the needs of the telecommunications providers. These needs include the cost to maintain the hardware needed for their services and the services themselves. In 2022 disbursements totaled $7.4 billion, split across the USF's four main programs: $2.1 billion for the E-rate program, $4.2 billion for the high-cost program, $0.6 billion for the Lifeline program, and $0.5 billion for the rural health care program.:\u200a4\u200a\nUnlike many government programs which are funded by general Congressional appropriations, the Universal Service Fund is instead funded by a specific fee on United States telephone providers. While separate itemization is not required by the FCC, it is common for USF fees to be listed separately from other charges on a consumer's bill. As of 2024, the rate for the USF budget was 34.4% of a telecom company's interstate and international end-user revenues.\nThe structure and funding of the USF has been subject to significant criticism and proposed reforms. One issue is a declining revenue base: consumers' spending on the interstate telephone service that funds the USF has been falling for many years. Some have challenged the constitutionality of having USF fees set without congressional approval and the delegation of authority to the private USAC.", "citation": "WIKI49281", "id": "WIKI49281", "type": "Wikipedia", "doc_id": "49281", "source_document": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund", "source_dataset": "Wikipedia", "topics": "", "active": true, "date": "2025-06-08", "text": "**Title**: Universal Service Fund\n\n**Report ID:** WIKI49281\n\n**Publication Date:**: 2025-06-08\n\n- **Background** `[WIKI49281__1___1]`:\n - In the modern sense of offering service to all people, the promotion of universal service in telecommunications was crystalized in the 1960s. Some sources point to the earlier Communications Act of 1934 as promoting universal service based on the language of its preamble, but other historians have pointed out that in the early 20th century \"universal service\" was originally an AT&T marketing slogan about telephone interconnection, not evolving into a legal mandate to serve every American until much later.\n  - **Implicit subsidies for local service (1970-1982)** `[WIKI49281__1___2]`:\n   - In the 1960s the telecommunication monopolies were shocked by new evolving technologies and competitions: new long-distance carriers and microwave networks were authorized. Companies such as MCI Communications began to offer long-distance service in direction competition to AT&T. With falling costs on long-distance service, regulators decided to reallocate the increasing profit on long-distance telecommunication to fund subsidies to make local telephone connection more affordable. This process began in the mid 1960 and was institutionalized through the Ozark plan of 1970 into action. At the time of the institutionalization telephone penetration ranged between 85 and 95%. There has been some dispute about whether the charges paid from long distance service to local carriers were a subsidy or not.\n   - Legally, jurisdiction to regulate rates was split between the Federal Communications Comision (international and interstate) and state commissions (intrastate). During the 91st congress, Fred B. Rooney introduced H.R. 12150 creating a joint board between the Federal Communications Commission and the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners to clearly delineate how telephone regulation was separated by jurisdiction. The joint board met on a voluntary basis and authored the Ozark plan. The situation was then formalized when the bill was reintroduced in the next congress as H.R. 7048 The Federal-State Commissions Joint Board Act and passed into law in 1971.\n  - **Breakup of the Bell system (1982-1996)** `[WIKI49281__1___3]`:\n   - There was a push for deregulating the telecommunications industry in the 1980s. Under President Ronald Reagan, the FCC shifted its focus from \"social equity to an economic efficiency objective,\" which it claimed was a primary purpose of the Communications Act of 1934. After AT&T was split up in 1984, universal service was still \"supported by a system of above-cost access charges paid to local exchange companies.\" This system was administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association.\n- **History** `[WIKI49281__2___1]`:\n\n  - **Telecommunications Act of 1996** `[WIKI49281__2___2]`:\n   - The Universal Service Fund was first codified in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the first major rewrite of the Communications Act of 1934. The act addresses new challenges and opportunities of the digital information age, with the goal of promoting an economic environment conducive for the growth of new information technology. It also further developed the meaning and implementation of universal service. The act calls for the creation of a joint federal-state board to make recommendations to the FCC on defining federal universal services and set time tables. The act also set out immediate priorities of universal service. These include quality and reasonably priced services, access to advanced telecommunication services, access for rural, low-income and high-cost regions, equitable and nondiscriminatory service, specific and predictable price structure, access of advanced telecommunication services for schools and health care and libraries (Sec. 254(b)(1)-(7)). The act provided ability in the constantly changing telecommunication environment to periodically revisit and adjust universal service, while setting core principles (Sec. 254(c)). The 1996 act also \"mandated the creation of the universal service fund (USF) into which all telecommunications providers are required to contribute a percentage of their interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues\".\n   - Increased competition and universal service were legislatively addressed and codified with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The major goals of Universal Service as mandated by the 1996 Act are as follows:\n   - Promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable and affordable rates for all consumers\n   - Increase nationwide access to advanced telecommunications services\n   - Advance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas, at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas\n   - Increase access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities\n   - Provide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs\n   - The 1996 Act states that all providers of telecommunications services should contribute to federal universal service in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner; there should be specific, predictable, and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service; all schools, classrooms, health care providers, and libraries should, generally, have access to advanced telecommunications services; and finally, that the Federal-State Joint Board and the FCC should determine those other principles that, consistent with the 1996 Act, are necessary to protect the public interest.\n   - In the past, only long-distance companies made contributions to support the federal Universal Service Fund. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded the types of companies contributing to the Universal Service Fund.\n  - **Expansion to Voice Over IP services** `[WIKI49281__2___3]`:\n   - Since the USF fees were originally designed to cover \"telecommunications services\", voice over IP services which run over the internet were initially not subject to USF fees. Critics argued this avoidance of USF fees helped make the fund unsustainable. In June 2006, the FCC voted to require providers of VoIP services to contribute to the Universal Service Fund the same way traditional telephone services had been contributing.\n   - After the 2018 USF changes, VoIP service providers are now required to provide funds for the USF. However, they are exempt from the cost of using the Internet for information transport whereas DSL internet providers and modern cable services must burden the cost. This expands cost distortion to long-distance telephone providers and it raises the cost of telecommunications service for more consumers.\n  - **Expansion of the fund into broadband** `[WIKI49281__2___4]`:\n   - The concept of universal service may include other telecommunications-information services, mainly Internet access.\n   - Many of the services covered by the USF are related to traditional telephone technology. There is a rising concern that more recent developments in telecommunications are just as important to the consumer as these older technologies. For example, consumers' subscriptions to traditional telephone services have fallen while their subscription rate to wireless services have been rising consistently. Yet many cellular companies are likely to receive less funding under the new rules, which may reduce consumers' access to wireless services in areas of the country that have low populations. Similarly, a question currently debated is whether access to broadband internet should be supported by the USF and if so, how best to fulfill such a large mandate without damaging the stability of the fund. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 states that \"advanced services\" should be accessible to all Americans [Section 254(b)(3)]. One question is whether the providers of internet access should contribute to the fund like other companies that provide access to telecommunications, if such providers also want to draw from the fund. Supporters of including internet access in the Universal Service Fund include former Congressman Rick Boucher (D-VA)\n   - Adding additional services to the fund has corporate support from major telecommunication companies, including Verizon and AT&T. In March 2009, senior executives from Verizon Communications met with the House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet, providing recommendations for how best to proceed bringing broadband and mobile communication access to rural and unserved areas. Citing reform to the Universal Service Fund as a means \"to better serve rural America,\" Verizon recommended that a limit be set on the size of USF's high-cost fund, competitive bidding wars be employed to determine which company expand service to unserved areas, structure a \"wire-center approach\" model to replace statewide cost averaging, restructure how contributions to the USF are determined, and impose a deadline on the FCC for completion of their reform of inter-carrier compensation.\n   - Unions such as the Communications Workers of America also endorsed the expansion the Unviersal Service Fund into supporting broadband.\n   - On the other hand, discussions continued over whether the USF should be used to provide services such as broadband internet access. Plans to subsidize internet service providers has led to backlash from traditional telecommunications carriers. Traditional carriers argue that \u201cthe relevant provisions of the 1996 Act do not give the FCC carte blanche to play regulatory Robin Hood with their universal service contributions.\u201d \n   - In October 2011 the FCC formally proposed a \"Connect America Fund\" to address these and other concerns. Reform finally arrived on October 27, 2011, when the FCC approved a six-year transfer process that would transition money from the Universal Service Fund to a new $4.5 billion a year Connect America Fund that will support the expansion of broadband services to areas that don't have broadband access yet.\n  - **Recent history (2014-present)** `[WIKI49281__2___5]`:\n   - In May 2018, the FCC moved $8 billion from a private bank to the US Treasury. This anticipated move caused an uproar from FCC Democratic commissioners who were concerned about the money being allocated to large corporations instead of the citizens. FCC commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel stated that this move \"sacrificed $50 million in annual interest that could have been used to support rural broadband, telemedicine & internet in schools.\" Although lawmakers and commissioners claimed that this move was unexpected, there was a letter previously written to the General Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2018 asking for a review on the plan to review the funds. The GAO claimed that the USF funds are not regulated as intensively as other government funds, so this move was an attempt to \"improve management and oversight of the funds.\"\n   - On May 21, 2018, the FCC issued an order that prohibited USF programs from buying equipment from Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE. These companies are considered a risk to national security by American intelligence agencies. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow commented that the Trump Administration are \u00a8aware of security issues, sanctions issues, technology theft issues, et cetera.\u00a8\n- **Components** `[WIKI49281__3___1]`:\n\n  - **High Cost** `[WIKI49281__3___2]`:\n   - The largest and most complex of the four programs, the high cost program subsidizes telecommunications services in rural and remote areas which are more expensive to connect to networks. The program paid out $4.2 billion in subsidies to telecommunications companies in 2022,:\u200a20\u200a with a goal of making telecommunications affordable to rural and remote areas. The program has been criticized as wasteful, granting large sums of money to telecommunications companies while having little effect on access.\n   - To determine eligibility for the high-cost program, each US state is broken into geographically into one or more study areas. A study area is defined by each study area's incumbent local exchange carrier, the modern successor of the local telephone monopoly. Incumbent local exchange carriers are sub-classified into those that operate on rate-of-return (ROR) model, and those subject to price caps (PC).\n   - According to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, in order to be eligible for USF support, carriers must be legally designated as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) and take on a legal obligation to serve everyone in a particular area. State utility commissions are primarily responsible for defining both the number of eligible telecommunications carriers and the areas that they must serve.\n   - During the time of the Bell system and up through the 1980s, the traditional business model for an incumbent local exchange carrier was operating as a rate-of-return (ROR) carrier. These companies operated as regulated monopolies with profits limited to set percentage of total investment. As of 2019, companies that continue to operate as rate-of-return carriers are generally small, rural carriers serving 5% or less of households in the United States. About $2.5 billion in high-cost support goes to these rate-of-return carriers. Rate-of-return companies have two options for how to receive high-cost funds. First, they can opt for the traditional cost-accounting mechanism, under which the high cost will reimburse the company for their deployment costs plus an additional 10.25% return on investment. Alternatively, rate-of-return companies can choose model-based support, where costs are estimated in advance. The type of subsidy across rate-of-return study areas is split between the two support mechanisms, with about 40% of rate-of-return study areas operating under the traditional mechanism and 60% opting for model-based support.\n   - In response to the criticism of the rate-of-return model, the FCC made efforts to encourage carriers to voluntarily move to a price cap (PC) approach. Beginning in 1990, the FCC began applying a Price Cap approach under which local exchange carriers would be allowed to adjust rates within the price cap without lengthy regulatory filings and deliberation.\n    - **Telephone funds** `[WIKI49281__3___3]`:\n     - From 1998 to 2009, the high-cost fund supported the programs detailed below, which are aimed at telephone service. With the advent of the Connect America Fund, most of these programs have been phased out.\n     - Legacy High cost programs:\n     - High Cost Loop Support (HCLS) - The longest running High Cost fund. According to the benchmark established in 1988, telephone companies with fixed costs of more than 115% of the national average would have 65% of excess costs covered, and fixed costs above 150% of the national average would receive a 75% subsidy. In dollar terms high cost loop support grew from $56 million in 1986 to $1.47 billion in 2010. Historically available to all telephone carriers, the fund's eligibility was later narrowed to rural telephone carriers. Safety Valve Support (SVS) is a supplement to HCLS. Safety Net Additive Support (SNAS) is another former supplement to HCLS.\n     - High Cost Model Support (HCMS) - Another former program.\n     - Local Switching Support (LSS) - Another former program.\n     - Long Term Support (LTS) - Another former program, ended in July 2004 and replaced by the ICLS.\n     - Interstate Common Line Support (ICLS) - Another former legacy High Cost fund going to rate-of-return carriers. For rate-of return carriers, costs to maintain infrastructure between the consumer and the local exchange are assumed to be 25% intrastate and 75% interstate. If federal subscriber line charges (SLC) and the bills paid by customers do not cover the companies' interstate common line costs, the ICLS will make up the difference. This original fund covered telephone service, but in practice covered infrastructure that could often also be used for broadband. As originally formulated, the fund could not be used for broadband-only service. Then in 2016 subsidies were expanded to also include broadband-only service, and renamed the Connect America Fund Broadband Loop Support (CAF BLS).\n     - Interstate Access Support (IAS) - Another former program, analogous to ICLS, but for Price Cap Carriers.\n    - **Connect America Fund** `[WIKI49281__3___4]`:\n     - As part of the National Broadband Plan proposed in March 2010, the FCC proposed reorganizing the High Cost program into a new \"Connect America Fund\", which will include both voice and 4 Mbit/s internet connectivity. On October 27, 2011, the FCC approved a six-year transfer process that would transition the money from the Universal Service Fund High-Cost Program into the new $4.5 billion a year Connect America Fund, effectively putting an end to the USF High-Cost Fund by 2018.\n     - Post-2010 High cost programs:\n     - Frozen High Cost Support (FHCS) - After the announcement of the Connect America Fund, the existing subsidies to Price Cap Carriers and to Competitive Local Exchange Carriers was frozen at 2011 levels.\n     - Intercarrier Compensation Recovery (ICC) - Another legacy High Cost fund. In 2011, the FCC announced its intention to gradually move intercarrier compensation to a Bill and keep model. Traditionally, local exchange carriers would charge other carriers for calls terminating through their network. The ICC was set up to partially replace the revenue that local exchange carriers previously collected from intercarrier compensation.\n     - Connect America Fund, Phase I Incremental Support - This program, also known simply as Incremental Support was a program aimed at accelerating broadband deployment active from 2012 to 2014. In 2012, during \"Phase I\" of the Connect America Fund, $115 million in subsidies were given out to build out broadband in 37 states, with $71.9 million going to Frontier Communications and $35 million to Century Link, with AT&T and Verizon declining to participate. In 2013, also during \"Phase I\", CenturyLink accepted another $54 million, and AT&T accepted $100 million.\n     - Connect America Fund Phase II Model - In March 2014, the FCC approved \"Connect America Fund Phase II Model\", moving $1.8 billion a year in funding from telephone subsidies to broadband, and clarifying the specifics of the funding process. Under the framework the FCC approved, incumbent carriers have priority access to subsidies, but if the funds are declined, the funds are allocated by a competitive bidding process. The FCC also proposed upping the minimum speed requirement from 4 Mbit/s to 10 Mbit/s. In May 2014, the 10th circuit court of appeals upheld the shift in funds in the face of a legal challenge by telephone companies.\n     - Connect America Fund Broadband Loop Support (CAF BLS) - Rate-of-return carriers that did elect to adopt ACAM II support were moved to the legacy mechanism CAF BLS.\n     - Connect America Fund Phase II Auction (CAFII Auc) - In 2018, the FCC conducted an auction awarding 103 companies a total of $1.49 billion over 10 years. This included all areas which were not covered by the previous Connect America Fund Phase II Model.\n     - Alternative Connect America Model (ACAM)/Revised Alternative Connect America Model (Revised ACAM) - In March 2016, the FCC unanimously voted to provide $20 billion over the next 10 years in \"support for small carriers.\" The FCC will be offering the fund $20 billion over the next 10 years to support service in \"high cost areas.\" This reform is a modernization of the program support of broadband in \"high cost areas.\" It will target communities that most need support. The reform is made up of three main elements: \"Modernizes Existing Universal Service Program for Rate-of-Return Carriers\", \"Create Two Paths to a 'Connect America Fund' for Rate-of Return Carriers\" and \"Increase Fiscal Responsibility in the Universal Service Fund.\"\n     - Alternative Connect America Model II (ACAM II)\n     - Enhanced Alternative Connect America Model (Enhanced ACAM) - In 2023 the FCC created this program for Rate-of-Return carriers to transition away from ACAM, Revised ACAM, ACAM II, and CAF BLS.\n     - Alaska Plan (AK Plan) - In 2016, the FCC established the Alaska plan, which offers fixed support of $150 million a year for 10 years (2017-2026), for $1.5 billion total to extend 10/1 Mbps broadband service to high cost areas in Alaska.\n     - Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund/Connect USVI Fund consists of several programs specifically for the Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands: Bringing Puerto Rico Together Fixed Support (PR Fixed), Bringing Puerto Rico Together Mobile Support (PR Mobile), United States Virgin Islands Fixed Support (USVI Fixed), and United States Virgin Islands Mobile Support (USVI Mobile).\n     - Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) - In 2020, the FCC announced $9.2 billion in funding to build rural broadband networks. Recipients included LTD Broadband at $1.1 billion and SpaceX's Starlink at $885 million. LTD won bids to build broadband in 15 states, but was had its application to be designated an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier rejected in 6 of those states, due to doubts about its ability to complete the buildout. The FCC later withdrew the RDOF funding for both LTD and Starlink.\n     - Rural Broadband Experiments (RBE)\n     - Mobility Fund Phase I - The Connect America Fund also included the Mobility Fund, which is given to wireless carriers who expand service to underserved areas. \"Phase I\" of the Mobility Fund offered $300 million for a September 2012 round of auctions, and \"Phase II\" of the Mobility Fund plans to give out $500 million in annual support.\n    - **Summary** `[WIKI49281__3___5]`:\n     - \u2020 Programs marked with a dagger symbol were funded from the High Cost account, so do not appear in the total funding projection.\n    - **Proposed High Cost programs** `[WIKI49281__3___6]`:\n     - Some programs have been proposed, but not yet implemented.\n     - Mobility Fund Phase II - In 2017, new FCC chairman Ajit Varadaraj Pai promoted this fund as a way to expand 4G broadband access to rural areas. He wanted to bridge \"the digital divide between rural and urban areas\" by working on \"expanding broadband options\". Pai believes that there is waste occurring between the private and public sectors as private capital is already being given to areas in order to build out networks. However, some of these areas are still being subsidized. Pai intends to make sure that broadband accessibility is included in an infrastructure bill to come. The proposed program for $4.53 billion over 10 years, but was canceled in favor of the 5G Fund for Rural America.\n     - 5G Fund for Rural America (5G Fund) - A planned fund to build out 5G wireless service via a reverse auction.\n  - **Low income (Lifeline)** `[WIKI49281__3___7]`:\n   - Since 1985, the Lifeline program has provided subsidies to low-income people to pay for phone service; first landlines, then cellphones, and as of 2016 it also offers the option of Internet connectivity. It provides a subsidy of up to $9.25 a month for Americans below 135% of the poverty line. Residents of Native American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities may qualify for enhanced Lifeline assistance (up to an additional $25.00). The Lifeline program is limited to one discount per household. A \"household\" includes anyone living at the same address \"who share income(s) and household expenses\".\n   - The Lifeline program has been subject to scrutiny and debate over the scope of the program. Issues include instituting checks for income eligibility and duplicate applications, whether the program should support broadband, whether the program should have a budget cap.\n  - **Rural health care** `[WIKI49281__3___8]`:\n   - The Rural Health Care Support program \"provides funding to eligible health care providers (HCPs) for telecommunications and broadband services necessary for the provision of health care.\"\n   - The rural health care program provides subsidies to health care providers for telehealth and telemedicine services, typically by a combination of video-conferencing infrastructure and high speed Internet access, to enable doctors and patients in rural hospitals to access specialists in distant cities at affordable rates. The Rural Health Care Support Mechanism allows rural health care providers to pay rates for telecommunications services similar to those of their urban counterparts, making telehealth services affordable. Over $417 million has been allocated for the construction of 62 statewide or regional broadband telehealth networks in 42 states and three U.S. territories under the Rural Health Care Pilot Program. In 2022, the rural health care program paid out $488 million.:\u200a20\u200a\n   - There are three components of the Rural Health Care Program: Telecommunications Program, HCF Program, Pilot Program.\n   - \"The Telecommunications Program (formerly known as the Primary Program) provides discounts for telecommunications services for eligible health care providers (HCPs).\"\n   - \"The Healthcare Connect Fund (HCF) Program is the newest component of the Rural Health Care Program. The HCF Program will provide a 65 percent discount on eligible expenses related to broadband connectivity to both individual rural health care providers (HCPs) and consortia, which can include non-rural HCPs (if the consortium has a majority of rural sites).\"\n   - \"The Pilot Program provides funding for up to 85 percent of eligible costs of the construction or implementation of statewide and/or regional broadband networks. There are 50 active projects involving hundreds of health care providers (HCPs).\"\n  - **Schools and Libraries Program (E-Rate)** `[WIKI49281__3___9]`:\n   - The E-Rate program provides subsidies for Internet access and general telecommunications services to schools and libraries. The subsidies typically pay 20% to 90% of costs based on need, with rural and low-income schools receiving the greatest subsidy. In 2022, the E-Rate program paid out $2.1 billion. Every year since 2010, the Wireline Competition Bureau announces the funding cap for the E-Rate program to adhere to the current needs of schools and libraries telecommunications.\n   - \"The Eligible Services List (ESL) for each funding year provides guidance on the eligibility of products and services under the Schools and Libraries Program.\" In 2015, USAC outlined two specific categories for grouping the ESL, and one category for miscellaneous services.\n   - \"Category One\n   - Data Transmission Services and Internet Access, and Voice Services\n   - Category two\n   - Internal Connections, Managed Internal Broadband Services, and Basic Maintenance of Internal Connections\n   - Miscellaneous\"\n   - Starting in the 2011 funding year, the different types of schools eligible to receive benefits now include:\n   - \"School on Tribal lands\n   - Schools that serve children with physical, cognitive, and behavioral disabilities\n   - Schools that serve children with medical needs\n   - Juvenile justice schools, where eligible\n   - Schools with 35 percent or more students eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).\"\n- **Administration** `[WIKI49281__4___1]`:\n\n  - **Universal Service Administrative Company** `[WIKI49281__4___2]`:\n   - Following the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the subsequent creation of the Universal Service Fund, the FCC designated the independent American nonprofit corporation named the \"Universal Service Administrative Company\" to manage the contribution of revenue to and distribution of funding from the Universal Service Fund. The Schools and Libraries Corporation and the Rural Health Care Corporation were merged into the USAC on January 1, 1999. The USAC is a fully owned legal subsidiary of the National Exchange Carrier Association, but is governed by a separate 20-person board of directors serving 3 year terms representing various stakeholder interests.\n   - USAC reports quarterly revenue projections detailing what contributions are expected and detailing what actions are taken in the expansion and bolstering of universal service. The USAC receives contributions from all companies providing interstate and international telephone and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service. Contributors send payments based on projected quarterly earnings. The FCC does not require companies to charge their customers for these contributions \u2013 this funding decision is left up to the individual companies. This revenue is deposited into a central fund, from which the USAC distributes money to the four central services at the core of the USF: High Cost, Low Income, Schools and Libraries, and Rural Health Care.\n   - \"The USAC collects revenue data from USF contributors on the FCC Form 499-A (Annual Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet) and FCC Form 499-Q (Quarterly Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet).\" The USAC is responsible for estimating how much money is needed for the USF program. The USAC provides a \"demand filing,\" to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) each quarter in its FCC Filings.\n   - While the USAC cannot act without Congressional approval, it can make recommendations. USAC recommendations have resulted in expanding telecommunication resources, particularly broadband Internet and mobile access to schools and libraries, and recognizing VoIP as a form of interstate and international communication, which requires those companies providing VoIP services to contribute to the USF.\n  - **Federal Communications Commission** `[WIKI49281__4___3]`:\n   - The FCC oversees the USAC's administration of the Universal Service Fund, and institutes reforms as it sees fit. Although the fund is limited by the scope of US law, (mainly the 1996 Telecommunications Act)\n   - the FCC has played a part in making several changes to the fund, including shifting funds from the high cost program towards broadband expansion. Under the FCC, there is an Enforcement Bureau that investigates and pursues the violators of the Act of 1996 and any Commissions rules.\n  - **National Exchange Carrier Association** `[WIKI49281__4___4]`:\n   - The National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) collects rate-of-return carrier cost data, does initial validation, and calculates how much funding carriers are eligible for and forwards all this information to the USAC.\n   - The NECA is also the legal parent of the USAC, but maintains a separate board.\n  - **Federal-state joint boards** `[WIKI49281__4___5]`:\n   - Beginning in the 1980s, the Federal-State Joint Board on Jurisdictional Separations made recommendations for the establishment of a universal service fund. They issued Monitoring Reports overseeing the early Universal Service fund from 1987 to 1997.\n   - The Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service was established in March 1996 to make recommendations on the implementation of the universal service provisions of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. This board has taken over preparing Monitoring Reports concerning the Universal Service Fund.\n- **Funding** `[WIKI49281__5___1]`:\n - Currently, all telecommunications companies that provide service between states, including long-distance companies, local telephone companies, wireless telephone companies, paging companies, and payphone providers, are legally required to contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund. Carriers providing international services also must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. These providers contribute to the fund \"based on their interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues.\" On a quarterly basis, the Universal Service Administrative Company submits projected demand for Universal Service funding and projected contribution base to the Federal Communications Commission Office of Managing Director (OMD). There is then a 14-day public review, after which the rate is finalized. As of the third quarter of 2024, telecommunication companies were required to contribute 34.4% of their interstate revenue to the fund.\n - While many providers bundle phone calls within a state (intrastate), calls between states (interstate), and calls to between countries (international) into a single monthly fee, the USF fee does not apply to revenue generated from calls within a single state. Therefore, phone companies apply the USF fee only to the interstate and international revenue. To accomplish this, they can opt to apply the USF fee to the \"safe-harbor percentage\" of assumed interstate revenue (64.9% for VoIP, 37.1% for cellular service). Alternatively, companies can conduct a traffic study demonstrating the percentage of interstate usage (PIU) and submit it to the Universal Service Administrative Company.\n - While not required to do so, most telephone companies bill their customers with a separate line item for the USF fee. The contributions are collected by the Universal Service Administrative Company and disbursed towards four programs that the federal USF supports, as directed by the FCC. Universal Service charges should not be confused with what are sometimes referred to in telephone company bills as \"Federal Subscriber Line\" charges, which are access fees charged by telecommunications companies, not the local or federal government.\n  - **Declining revenues** `[WIKI49281__5___2]`:\n   - The rapidly changing interstate and international telecommunications markets can quickly and unpredictably bring about changes in USF funding levels. Dorothy Attwood of the FCC Wireline Competition Bureau stated, \"One striking development that we've witnessed in the interstate marketplace is the steady decline of interstate revenues. Although traditional long-distance revenues grew consistently between 1984 and 1997, they're now in a period of steady decline\". She pointed out that competition in the interstate long-distance market, wireless substitution, and bundling of service packages that blur traditional service categories are all reducing revenues that serve to finance the USF. Service providers simply transferred the cost to customers in the form of a long-distance surcharge to make up for reduced revenue. While the expenditures of the USF have increased since its inception, in part due to expansion of support paid to competitive providers, the revenues on which contributions are made \u2013 interstate and international telecommunications revenues \u2013 have become increasingly more difficult for contributors to identify as a result of evolution of services offered. Overall revenues reported by telecommunications companies have steadily increased, if information service revenues are included. However, the revenues for these services are no longer subject to contribution.\n   - Some have raised concerns about the future funding of the USF; despite falling taxable revenues, the size of the fund has increased from $1.2 billion in collections at 5.7% in 4Q 2000, to $2.2 billion in 4Q 2014 at 16.1%.\n- **State universal service funds** `[WIKI49281__6___1]`:\n - Many US States have their own universal service funds, with budget and administration independent of the much larger federal fund. States with their own programs may have their own eligibility guidelines. As of 2019, 42 states had universal service funds in addition to the federal program, totaling $1.7 billion in disbursements in 2017. Those without state funds consisted of Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Virginia.\n - To support the state programs, many states impose a fee on intrasate calling revenue (the portion not falling under the federal USF fee).\n- **Waste and fraud** `[WIKI49281__7___1]`:\n - The issue of waste and fraud, as with many government programs, has been addressed as well. Gilroy stated, \"The ability to ensure that only eligible services are funded, that funding is disbursed at the proper level of discount, that alleged services have been received, and the integrity of the competitive bidding process is upheld have been questioned\". Improved auditing of particularly the E-rate program has been addressed.\n - There have been multiple cases of waste and fraud throughout disbursement of subsidies from the Universal Service Fund. There is some concern on the lag time between application, approval, and actual receipt of funds. In terms of fraud, some school officials have been bribed by contractors working with corporations so that they use subsidies to purchase computer equipment from said corporation. In addition, some beneficiaries inaccurately report costs to inflate their subsidies amount. In terms of waste, some equipment subsidized by the USF has been left unused for several years.\n - An investigation into potential fraud in 2004 revealed that contractors working with Hewlett-Packard bribed school officials. Hewlett-Packard wanted the schools to use subsidies provided by the fund to purchase computer equipment from Hewlett-Packard. The second example of fraud was when \"Sandwich Isles Communication purposely inflated and inaccurately reported money to receive inflated subsidies.\"\n - Critics continue to raise concerns in regards to the wastefulness of the fund. For example, \"$5 million worth of equipment purchased by Chicago public schools with E-rate funds was left unused in a warehouse for years.\" Lastly, a problem that has plagued the program is the long lag time between the overall application of the programs and the approval.\n - The USF has some issues in dealing with insufficient controls over determining who qualifies for funding, and limited auditing practices that are supposed to ensure that telecommunication companies are not overpaying or underpaying their dues to the fund.\n - The USF is able to reward those living in rural or impoverished areas who are capable of paying the entire cost of personal telecommunication services. Critics argue that inconsistent and asymmetrical audits allow for wealthy consumers to avoid triggering some USF financial burdens. Wealthy landowners in rural estates decide to utilize USF subsidies and pay a fraction of what they can realistically afford.\n - Critics note that reimbursing carriers on a \u201c\u2018cost-plus\u2019 basis\u201d creates \u201cincentives to increase rather than decreas[e] costs\u201d By reimbursing \u201ccarriers for the full cost of infrastructure development plus 11.25 percent of those costs in profit,\u201d the fund may expose itself to exploitation.\n- **Proposed changes** `[WIKI49281__8___1]`:\n - Debate over the Universal Service Fund has consistently involved the scope of the funding, which technology types and companies should fund the program, which groups should be eligible for benefits, and the need to clean up waste and fraud in the program.\n  - **Legislative bills** `[WIKI49281__8___2]`:\n   - A draft proposal of the Telecommunications Act of 2005 was the subject of hearings in Congress. The proposal outlined a significant restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, ultimately the House of Representatives passed a bill, the Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Enhancement Act of 2006 (COPE \u2013 H.R.5252.RS, S. 2686). The bill was sent from the House to the Senate, where subsequent readings left it awaiting a legislative action. Under the proposed restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, greater emphasis on the wide availability of broadband and mobile access would be considered. Additionally, consideration of revenue contribution to the Universal Service Fund would be radically revised, given that the creation of obligatory broadband and mobile communication access would require a wide range of broadband, mobile, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service providers to contribute a portion of their revenue to the fund. Lastly, the Act urged an FCC consideration of the universal service structure. The bill was not passed.\n   - In January 2007, Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) sponsored a bill (the Universal Service for Americans Act, S. 101) that would increase universal service tax base to include broadband ISPs and VoIP providers, to fund broadband deployment in rural and low-income regions of the country. This bill was referred to committee, but as no further action was taken on it by the 110th Congress, the bill never became law.\n   - On February 13, 2009, Congressman Bob Latta (R-OH) introduced H.Res. 176 which states that, \"in order to continue aggressive growth in our Nation's telecommunications and technology industries, the United States Government should 'Get Out of the Way and Stay Out of the Way'.\" The bill died in committee.\n   - On July 22, 2010, the Universal Service Reform Act of 2010 was introduced by Representatives Boucher (D-Va) and Terry (R-NE). The measure is intended to improve and modernize the USF by reining in the size of the fund and promoting broadband deployment.\n   - On July 2, 2021 the Funding Affordable Internet with Reliable (FAIR) Contributions Act (S. 2427) was introduced by Roger Wicker (R-MS) to study the possibility of collecting USF contributions from edge providers. Wicker reintroduced the bill in the 118th congress (S. 856). The bill was endorsed by United States Telecom Association and NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association.\n   - On November 15, 2023 the Lowering Broadband Costs for Consumers Act of 2023 (S. 3321) was introduced by Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) to require internet service providers and edge providers to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The bill was supported by the United States Telecom Association and NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association.\n   - On May 1, 2024 the Promoting Affordable Connectivity Act (S. 4208) was introduced by John Fetterman (D-PA) to permanently extend the Affordable Connectivity Program by merging it into the USF and requiring internet service providers and edge providers to pay into the USF.\n  - **Changes to funding sources** `[WIKI49281__8___3]`:\n   - Proposals have been made to increase the number of sources from which universal service fund is collected. Suggestions include requiring additional companies pay into the USF such internet service providers, large technology companies, including intrastate telephone services (calls within single states), or increasing contribution requirements from wireless communication providers.\n   - Alternatively, there have also been suggestions to move all funding to regular congressional appropriations.\n  - **Capping expenditures** `[WIKI49281__8___4]`:\n   - In 2019, the FCC considered instituting a spending cap on the USF fund. The measure was supported by some groups, such as the Technology Policy Institute. On the other hand the proposed cap was criticised by Ron Wyden among other US Senators.\n  - **Classification of internet service providers** `[WIKI49281__8___5]`:\n   - Over the years, disputes about legal classification of internet service providers as either common carriers or information services has had implications for the Universal Service fund, as the FCC has stronger legal authority to regulate common carriers.\n   - Around 2014, there was discussion about reclassifying broadband under Title II of the 1996 Telecommunications Act so the FCC would have the authority to enforce Net Neutrality.  Opponents of the move argued that this reclassification eventually be followed by requiring ISPs to pay into the USF as a new source of revenue for the fund. The FCC has made clear that the change does give it the power to do so, but will not require contributions on broadband Internet access revenues at this time, as the FCC will forbear from the contribution requirements in Section 254(d) of the Communications Act.\n   - In 2017, the FCC reversed its decision and reclassified ISPs as information services. Then in 2013, the FCC changed once again classified ISPs under Title II. The FCC has continued to exempt broadband providers from Universal Service fund fees, but groups such as NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association continue to push for USF fees to be expanded to ISPs.\n- **Court cases** `[WIKI49281__9___1]`:\n - Some telecommunications policy experts strongly dispute the delegation of authority to the USAC, arguing that the FCC ignores challenges to USAC policy from telephone carriers for fear that either an explicit endorsement or rejection would open up the FCC to lawsuits.\n - Because ISP's and traditional telecommunications carriers often provide similar services, the USF may \u201cviolate[] the pro-competitive precepts of the 1996 Act.\" These concerns and others, as well as longstanding opposition to the Universal Service Fund from government watchdogs and fiscal conservatives, inspired litigation in 2023 arguing that the fund violates the U.S. Constitution. The firm Consumers' Research filed lawsuits in the 5th, 6th, and 11th circuits. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals first ruled in Consumers\u2019 Research v. Federal Communications Commission that the fund is constitutional, but that ruling has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.  In the mean time, the Fifth Circuit has ruled that it is unconstitutional. This combination of rulings on legality of the USF has resulted in a circuit split. The Supreme Court accepted two petitions for review from Consumers' Research's cases, consolidating them into one case, FCC v. Consumers' Research, to be heard during its 2024-2025 term.\n - In 2008, Todd Heath sued Wisconsin Bell for overcharging schools and libraries beyond the \"lowest corresponding price\" required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In the 2025 case Wisconsin Bell, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Heath, the Supreme Court ruled that because E-Rate program is partially funded by government contributions, such overcharges can be prosecuted under the False Claims Act of 1863.\n- **See also** `[WIKI49281__10___1]`:\n - E-Rate\n - National broadband plans from around the world\n - Rural electrification\n - National Exchange Carrier Association\n- **References** `[WIKI49281__11___1]`:\n\n  - **Federal Communications Commission** `[WIKI49281__11___2]`:\n\n  - **Universal Service Administrative Company** `[WIKI49281__11___3]`:\n\n- **External links** `[WIKI49281__12___1]`:\n - FCC website\n - Universal Access (Free Press)\n - Universal Service Administrative Company\n - About the USAC Archived January 2, 2014, at the Wayback Machine\n - Schools & Libraries\n - High Cost\n - Low Income\n - Rural Healthcare\n - Committee on Energy and Commerce\n - LifelineSupport.org - official page for info on the program\n - Lifeline National Verifier - official page for verifying eligibility\n", "overview": "## Domestic Policy Overview - Structured Document\n\n**1.

Policy Background & Context**\n\n*   **Field: Historical Context Summary**\n    *   The promotion of universal service in telecommunications became prominent in the 1960s, although some trace it back to the Communications Act of 1934. `[WIKI49281__1___1]` Initially, \"universal service\" was an AT&T marketing slogan. `[WIKI49281__1___1]` In the 1960s, new long-distance carriers and microwave networks emerged, leading regulators to reallocate long-distance profits to subsidize local telephone connections. `[WIKI49281__1___2]` The Ozark plan of 1970 formalized this. `[WIKI49281__1___2]` The Federal-State Commissions Joint Board Act passed in 1971 formalized the separation of telephone regulation by jurisdiction. `[WIKI49281__1___2]` In the 1980s, there was a push for deregulation, and after the AT&T breakup in 1984, universal service was supported by above-cost access charges. `[WIKI49281__1___3]`\n*   **Field: Current Status/Situation Overview**\n    *   The Universal Service Fund faces challenges due to declining revenues from traditional telecommunications services. `[WIKI49281__5___2]` There are debates over whether the USF should support broadband and how to manage the fund's stability. `[WIKI49281__2___4]` The FCC has shifted funds towards broadband expansion through the Connect America Fund. `[WIKI49281__2___4]` There are concerns about waste, fraud, and insufficient controls within the USF. `[WIKI49281__7___1]`\n*   **Field: Key Legislation, Regulations, Constitutional Provisions, or Legal Frameworks Mentioned**\n    *   Communications Act of 1934: Some sources point to the earlier Communications Act of 1934 as promoting universal service based on the language of its preamble. `[WIKI49281__1___1]`\n    *   The Federal-State Commissions Joint Board Act (1971): Formally delineated how telephone regulation was separated by jurisdiction. `[WIKI49281__1___2]`\n    *   Telecommunications Act of 1996: Codified the Universal Service Fund and addressed new challenges of the digital age. `[WIKI49281__2___2]`\n    *   False Claims Act of 1863: Because E-Rate program is partially funded by government contributions, such overcharges can be prosecuted under the False Claims Act of 1863. `[WIKI49281__9___1]`\n\n---\n\n**4.

This process began in the mid 1960 and was institutionalized through the Ozark plan of 1970 into action. At the time of the institutionalization telephone penetration ranged between 85 and 95%.

It also further developed the meaning and implementation of universal service. The act calls for the creation of a joint federal-state board to make recommendations to the FCC on defining federal universal services and set time tables. The act also set out immediate priorities of universal service. These include quality and reasonably priced services, access to advanced telecommunication services, access for rural, low-income and high-cost regions, equitable and nondiscriminatory service, specific and predictable price structure, access of advanced telecommunication services for schools and health care and libraries (Sec. 254(b)(1)-(7)). The act provided ability in the constantly changing telecommunication environment to periodically revisit and adjust universal service, while setting core principles (Sec. 254(c)). The 1996 act also \"mandated the creation of the universal service fund (USF) into which all telecommunications providers are required to contribute a percentage of their interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues\".\nIncreased competition and universal service were legislatively addressed and codified with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The major goals of Universal Service as mandated by the 1996 Act are as follows:\n\nPromote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable and affordable rates for all consumers\nIncrease nationwide access to advanced telecommunications services\nAdvance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas, at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas\nIncrease access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities\nProvide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs\nThe 1996 Act states that all providers of telecommunications services should contribute to federal universal service in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner; there should be specific, predictable, and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service; all schools, classrooms, health care providers, and libraries should, generally, have access to advanced telecommunications services; and finally, that the Federal-State Joint Board and the FCC should determine those other principles that, consistent with the 1996 Act, are necessary to protect the public interest.\nIn the past, only long-distance companies made contributions to support the federal Universal Service Fund.

However, they are exempt from the cost of using the Internet for information transport whereas DSL internet providers and modern cable services must burden the cost.

There is a rising concern that more recent developments in telecommunications are just as important to the consumer as these older technologies. For example, consumers' subscriptions to traditional telephone services have fallen while their subscription rate to wireless services have been rising consistently. Yet many cellular companies are likely to receive less funding under the new rules, which may reduce consumers' access to wireless services in areas of the country that have low populations. Similarly, a question currently debated is whether access to broadband internet should be supported by the USF and if so, how best to fulfill such a large mandate without damaging the stability of the fund. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 states that \"advanced services\" should be accessible to all Americans [Section 254(b)(3)]. One question is whether the providers of internet access should contribute to the fund like other companies that provide access to telecommunications, if such providers also want to draw from the fund. Supporters of including internet access in the Universal Service Fund include former Congressman Rick Boucher (D-VA)\nAdding additional services to the fund has corporate support from major telecommunication companies, including Verizon and AT&T. In March 2009, senior executives from Verizon Communications met with the House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet, providing recommendations for how best to proceed bringing broadband and mobile communication access to rural and unserved areas. Citing reform to the Universal Service Fund as a means \"to better serve rural America,\" Verizon recommended that a limit be set on the size of USF's high-cost fund, competitive bidding wars be employed to determine which company expand service to unserved areas, structure a \"wire-center approach\" model to replace statewide cost averaging, restructure how contributions to the USF are determined, and impose a deadline on the FCC for completion of their reform of inter-carrier compensation.\nUnions such as the Communications Workers of America also endorsed the expansion the Unviersal Service Fund into supporting broadband.\nOn the other hand, discussions continued over whether the USF should be used to provide services such as broadband internet access. Plans to subsidize internet service providers has led to backlash from traditional telecommunications carriers. Traditional carriers argue that \u201cthe relevant provisions of the 1996 Act do not give the FCC carte blanche to play regulatory Robin Hood with their universal service contributions.\u201d \nIn October 2011 the FCC formally proposed a \"Connect America Fund\" to address these and other concerns. Reform finally arrived on October 27, 2011, when the FCC approved a six-year transfer process that would transition money from the Universal Service Fund to a new $4.5 billion a year Connect America Fund that will support the expansion of broadband services to areas that don't have broadband access yet.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "History", "level_1": "Expansion of the fund into broadband", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "History|Expansion of the fund into broadband", "citation": "WIKI49281__2___4"}, {"level": 1, "title": "Recent history (2014-present)", "text": "In May 2018, the FCC moved $8 billion from a private bank to the US Treasury.

FCC commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel stated that this move \"sacrificed $50 million in annual interest that could have been used to support rural broadband, telemedicine & internet in schools.\" Although lawmakers and commissioners claimed that this move was unexpected, there was a letter previously written to the General Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2018 asking for a review on the plan to review the funds. The GAO claimed that the USF funds are not regulated as intensively as other government funds, so this move was an attempt to \"improve management and oversight of the funds.\"\nOn May 21, 2018, the FCC issued an order that prohibited USF programs from buying equipment from Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE. These companies are considered a risk to national security by American intelligence agencies. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow commented that the Trump Administration are \u00a8aware of security issues, sanctions issues, technology theft issues, et cetera.\u00a8", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "History", "level_1": "Recent history (2014-present)", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "History|Recent history (2014-present)", "citation": "WIKI49281__2___5"}, {"level": 1, "title": "High Cost", "text": "The largest and most complex of the four programs, the high cost program subsidizes telecommunications services in rural and remote areas which are more expensive to connect to networks. The program paid out $4.2 billion in subsidies to telecommunications companies in 2022,:\u200a20\u200a with a goal of making telecommunications affordable to rural and remote areas. The program has been criticized as wasteful, granting large sums of money to telecommunications companies while having little effect on access.\nTo determine eligibility for the high-cost program, each US state is broken into geographically into one or more study areas. A study area is defined by each study area's incumbent local exchange carrier, the modern successor of the local telephone monopoly. Incumbent local exchange carriers are sub-classified into those that operate on rate-of-return (ROR) model, and those subject to price caps (PC).\nAccording to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, in order to be eligible for USF support, carriers must be legally designated as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) and take on a legal obligation to serve everyone in a particular area. State utility commissions are primarily responsible for defining both the number of eligible telecommunications carriers and the areas that they must serve.\n\nDuring the time of the Bell system and up through the 1980s, the traditional business model for an incumbent local exchange carrier was operating as a rate-of-return (ROR) carrier. These companies operated as regulated monopolies with profits limited to set percentage of total investment. As of 2019, companies that continue to operate as rate-of-return carriers are generally small, rural carriers serving 5% or less of households in the United States. About $2.5 billion in high-cost support goes to these rate-of-return carriers. Rate-of-return companies have two options for how to receive high-cost funds. First, they can opt for the traditional cost-accounting mechanism, under which the high cost will reimburse the company for their deployment costs plus an additional 10.25% return on investment. Alternatively, rate-of-return companies can choose model-based support, where costs are estimated in advance. The type of subsidy across rate-of-return study areas is split between the two support mechanisms, with about 40% of rate-of-return study areas operating under the traditional mechanism and 60% opting for model-based support.\nIn response to the criticism of the rate-of-return model, the FCC made efforts to encourage carriers to voluntarily move to a price cap (PC) approach. Beginning in 1990, the FCC began applying a Price Cap approach under which local exchange carriers would be allowed to adjust rates within the price cap without lengthy regulatory filings and deliberation.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "Components", "level_1": "High Cost", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "Components|High Cost", "citation": "WIKI49281__3___2"}, {"level": 2, "title": "Connect America Fund", "text": "As part of the National Broadband Plan proposed in March 2010, the FCC proposed reorganizing the High Cost program into a new \"Connect America Fund\", which will include both voice and 4 Mbit/s internet connectivity.

In 2011, the FCC announced its intention to gradually move intercarrier compensation to a Bill and keep model. Traditionally, local exchange carriers would charge other carriers for calls terminating through their network. The ICC was set up to partially replace the revenue that local exchange carriers previously collected from intercarrier compensation.\nConnect America Fund, Phase I Incremental Support - This program, also known simply as Incremental Support was a program aimed at accelerating broadband deployment active from 2012 to 2014. In 2012, during \"Phase I\" of the Connect America Fund, $115 million in subsidies were given out to build out broadband in 37 states, with $71.9 million going to Frontier Communications and $35 million to Century Link, with AT&T and Verizon declining to participate. In 2013, also during \"Phase I\", CenturyLink accepted another $54 million, and AT&T accepted $100 million.\nConnect America Fund Phase II Model - In March 2014, the FCC approved \"Connect America Fund Phase II Model\", moving $1.8 billion a year in funding from telephone subsidies to broadband, and clarifying the specifics of the funding process. Under the framework the FCC approved, incumbent carriers have priority access to subsidies, but if the funds are declined, the funds are allocated by a competitive bidding process. The FCC also proposed upping the minimum speed requirement from 4 Mbit/s to 10 Mbit/s. In May 2014, the 10th circuit court of appeals upheld the shift in funds in the face of a legal challenge by telephone companies.\nConnect America Fund Broadband Loop Support (CAF BLS) - Rate-of-return carriers that did elect to adopt ACAM II support were moved to the legacy mechanism CAF BLS.\nConnect America Fund Phase II Auction (CAFII Auc) - In 2018, the FCC conducted an auction awarding 103 companies a total of $1.49 billion over 10 years.

These providers contribute to the fund \"based on their interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues.\" On a quarterly basis, the Universal Service Administrative Company submits projected demand for Universal Service funding and projected contribution base to the Federal Communications Commission Office of Managing Director (OMD). There is then a 14-day public review, after which the rate is finalized. As of the third quarter of 2024, telecommunication companies were required to contribute 34.4% of their interstate revenue to the fund.\nWhile many providers bundle phone calls within a state (intrastate), calls between states (interstate), and calls to between countries (international) into a single monthly fee, the USF fee does not apply to revenue generated from calls within a single state. Therefore, phone companies apply the USF fee only to the interstate and international revenue. To accomplish this, they can opt to apply the USF fee to the \"safe-harbor percentage\" of assumed interstate revenue (64.9% for VoIP, 37.1% for cellular service). Alternatively, companies can conduct a traffic study demonstrating the percentage of interstate usage (PIU) and submit it to the Universal Service Administrative Company.\nWhile not required to do so, most telephone companies bill their customers with a separate line item for the USF fee. The contributions are collected by the Universal Service Administrative Company and disbursed towards four programs that the federal USF supports, as directed by the FCC.

Although traditional long-distance revenues grew consistently between 1984 and 1997, they're now in a period of steady decline\". She pointed out that competition in the interstate long-distance market, wireless substitution, and bundling of service packages that blur traditional service categories are all reducing revenues that serve to finance the USF. Service providers simply transferred the cost to customers in the form of a long-distance surcharge to make up for reduced revenue. While the expenditures of the USF have increased since its inception, in part due to expansion of support paid to competitive providers, the revenues on which contributions are made \u2013 interstate and international telecommunications revenues \u2013 have become increasingly more difficult for contributors to identify as a result of evolution of services offered. Overall revenues reported by telecommunications companies have steadily increased, if information service revenues are included. However, the revenues for these services are no longer subject to contribution.\nSome have raised concerns about the future funding of the USF; despite falling taxable revenues, the size of the fund has increased from $1.2 billion in collections at 5.7% in 4Q 2000, to $2.2 billion in 4Q 2014 at 16.1%.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "Funding", "level_1": "Declining revenues", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "Funding|Declining revenues", "citation": "WIKI49281__5___2"}, {"level": 0, "title": "Waste and fraud", "text": "The issue of waste and fraud, as with many government programs, has been addressed as well.

Improved auditing of particularly the E-rate program has been addressed.\nThere have been multiple cases of waste and fraud throughout disbursement of subsidies from the Universal Service Fund. There is some concern on the lag time between application, approval, and actual receipt of funds. In terms of fraud, some school officials have been bribed by contractors working with corporations so that they use subsidies to purchase computer equipment from said corporation. In addition, some beneficiaries inaccurately report costs to inflate their subsidies amount. In terms of waste, some equipment subsidized by the USF has been left unused for several years.\nAn investigation into potential fraud in 2004 revealed that contractors working with Hewlett-Packard bribed school officials. Hewlett-Packard wanted the schools to use subsidies provided by the fund to purchase computer equipment from Hewlett-Packard. The second example of fraud was when \"Sandwich Isles Communication purposely inflated and inaccurately reported money to receive inflated subsidies.\"\nCritics continue to raise concerns in regards to the wastefulness of the fund. For example, \"$5 million worth of equipment purchased by Chicago public schools with E-rate funds was left unused in a warehouse for years.\" Lastly, a problem that has plagued the program is the long lag time between the overall application of the programs and the approval.\nThe USF has some issues in dealing with insufficient controls over determining who qualifies for funding, and limited auditing practices that are supposed to ensure that telecommunication companies are not overpaying or underpaying their dues to the fund.\nThe USF is able to reward those living in rural or impoverished areas who are capable of paying the entire cost of personal telecommunication services. Critics argue that inconsistent and asymmetrical audits allow for wealthy consumers to avoid triggering some USF financial burdens. Wealthy landowners in rural estates decide to utilize USF subsidies and pay a fraction of what they can realistically afford.\nCritics note that reimbursing carriers on a \u201c\u2018cost-plus\u2019 basis\u201d creates \u201cincentives to increase rather than decreas[e] costs\u201d By reimbursing \u201ccarriers for the full cost of infrastructure development plus 11.25 percent of those costs in profit,\u201d the fund may expose itself to exploitation.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "Waste and fraud", "level_1": "", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "Waste and fraud", "citation": "WIKI49281__7___1"}, {"level": 1, "title": "Legislative bills", "text": "A draft proposal of the Telecommunications Act of 2005 was the subject of hearings in Congress.

The bill was sent from the House to the Senate, where subsequent readings left it awaiting a legislative action. Under the proposed restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, greater emphasis on the wide availability of broadband and mobile access would be considered. Additionally, consideration of revenue contribution to the Universal Service Fund would be radically revised, given that the creation of obligatory broadband and mobile communication access would require a wide range of broadband, mobile, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service providers to contribute a portion of their revenue to the fund. Lastly, the Act urged an FCC consideration of the universal service structure. The bill was not passed.\nIn January 2007, Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) sponsored a bill (the Universal Service for Americans Act, S. 101) that would increase universal service tax base to include broadband ISPs and VoIP providers, to fund broadband deployment in rural and low-income regions of the country. This bill was referred to committee, but as no further action was taken on it by the 110th Congress, the bill never became law.\nOn February 13, 2009, Congressman Bob Latta (R-OH) introduced H.Res. 176 which states that, \"in order to continue aggressive growth in our Nation's telecommunications and technology industries, the United States Government should 'Get Out of the Way and Stay Out of the Way'.\" The bill died in committee.\nOn July 22, 2010, the Universal Service Reform Act of 2010 was introduced by Representatives Boucher (D-Va) and Terry (R-NE).

It was introduced in the House as the INVEST in America Act and nicknamed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. The act was initially a $547\u2013715 billion infrastructure package that included provisions related to federal highway aid, transit, highway safety, motor carrier, research, hazardous materials and rail programs of the Department of Transportation. After congressional negotiations, it was amended and renamed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to add funding for broadband access, clean water and electric grid renewal in addition to the transportation and road proposals of the original House bill. This amended version included approximately $1.2 trillion in spending, with $550 billion newly authorized spending on top of what Congress was planning to authorize regularly.\nThe amended bill was passed 69\u201330 by the Senate on August 10, 2021.

The detailed plan aimed to create millions of jobs, bolster labor unions, expand labor protections, and address climate change.\n\nLegislative history\nSenate passage\nIn mid-April 2021, Republican lawmakers offered a $568 billion counterproposal to the American Jobs Plan. On May 9, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said it should cost no more than $800 billion. On May 21, the administration reduced the price tag to $1.7 trillion, which was quickly rejected by Republicans. A day later, a bipartisan group within the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee announced that they had reached a deal for $304 billion in U.S. highway funding. This was approved unanimously by the committee on May 26. On June 4, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Peter DeFazio announced a $547 billion plan, called the INVEST in America Act, which would address parts of the American Jobs Plan. On July 1, the House passed an amended $715 billion infrastructure bill focused on land transportation and water.\nOn May 27, Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito presented a $928 billion plan, and on June 4, increased it by about $50 billion; this was quickly rejected by the Biden administration. On June 8, the administration shifted its focus to a bipartisan group of 20 senators, which had been working on a package tentatively priced around $900 billion. On June 10, a bipartisan group of 10 senators reached a deal costing $974 billion over five years; or about $1.2 trillion if stretched over eight years. On June 16, the plan was endorsed by a bipartisan group of 21 senators. On June 24, the bipartisan group met with the president and reached a compromise deal costing $1.2 trillion over eight years, which focuses on physical infrastructure (notably roads, bridges, railways, water, sewage, broadband, electric vehicles). This was planned to be paid for through reinforced Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collection, unspent COVID-19 relief funds, and other sources. By July 2021, the IRS portion of the funding had reportedly been scrapped. Biden stipulated that a separate \"human infrastructure\" bill (notably child care, home care, and climate change) \u2013 later known as the Build Back Better Act \u2013 must also pass, whether through bipartisanship or reconciliation, but later walked back this position. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi similarly stated that the House would not vote on the physical infrastructure bill until the larger bill passes in the Senate, despite the fact that reconciliation overrides much of the obstructive power of the filibuster.\nWhite House officials stated on July 7 that legislative text was nearing completion. On July 14, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced an energy bill expected to be included in the bipartisan package. On July 21, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer put forward a \"shell bill\" for a vote to kick off debate in the Senate, intending to add the bipartisan text via an amendment. On July 25, Republican senator Rob Portman stated that an agreement was \"about 90%\" complete, with mass transit being one remaining point of contention. On July 30, Portman stated that this had been resolved. On July 28, Senator Kyrsten Sinema stated that she did not support a reconciliation bill costing $3.5 trillion, breaking the stalemate and allowing the bipartisan bill to move forward. That day, the Senate voted 67\u201332 to advance the bill, and on July 30, voted 66\u201328 to proceed to its consideration. The legislation text was completed and substituted into the bill on August 1. On August 5, Schumer moved to truncate debate on the legislation, setting up a procedural vote on August 7, which passed 67\u201327. Fifteen or more amendments were expected to receive votes through the weekend. On August 10, the bill was passed by the Senate 69\u201330. It sets aside $550 billion in new spending.\nA procedural vote on a House rule concerning passing both bills passed along party lines on August 24.\n\nHouse passage\nIn early August, nine moderate Democrats called for an immediate House vote on the bill, citing a desire not to lose the momentum from the Senate passage of the bill. They committed to voting against taking up the reconciliation resolution until there was a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill. While both Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had reversed earlier positions to support passing the bipartisan bill separately, progressives including Congressional Progressive Caucus chairwoman Pramila Jayapal and Senator Bernie Sanders maintained that it be utilized as leverage to pass the most expensive reconciliation bill possible. The lack of a deal caused a late September House vote to be postponed. On October 2, Pelosi set a new deadline of October 31. By October 28, Jayapal and other progressive leaders indicated that they were willing to vote on the bill separately, but Sanders and others opposed this. On October 31, a majority of progressives signaled that they would support both bills.\nVotes on both bills were considered on November 5, but the hesitation of several moderates to pass the reconciliation bill before it could be scored by the Congressional Budget Office made passing the bipartisan bill unlikely.  Negotiations between centrist and progressive Democrats concluded with the centrists committing to passing the Build Back Better Act. The bill ultimately went to a vote, as did a rule to vote on the larger bill once it was scored, passing 228\u2013206; 13 Republicans joined all but six Democrats (members of \"the Squad\") in supporting the legislation. The six Democrats who voted 'No' stated that their opposition was because the legislation had been decoupled from the social-safety net provisions of the Build Back Better bill. Biden signed the bill into law at a signing ceremony on November 15.\n\nOriginal version of the IIJA\nThe following is the bill summary authorized by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) for the INVEST in America Act, the original version which passed the House on July 1, 2021:\n\n\"extends FY2021 enacted levels through FY2022 for federal-aid highway, transit, and safety programs;\nreauthorizes for FY2023-FY2026 several surface transportation programs, including the federal-aid highway program, transit programs, highway safety, motor carrier safety, and rail programs;\naddresses climate change, including strategies to reduce the climate change impacts of the surface transportation system and a vulnerability assessment to identify opportunities to enhance the resilience of the surface transportation system and ensure the efficient use of federal resources;\nrevises Buy America Act procurement requirements for highways, mass transit, and rail;\nestablishes a rural bridge rebuilding program to improve the safety and state of good repair of bridges in rural communities;\nimplements new safety requirements across all transportation modes; and\ndirects the Department of Transportation to establish a pilot program to demonstrate a national motor vehicle per-mile user fee to restore and maintain the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund and achieve and maintain a state of good repair in the surface transportation system.\"\nThe specific amounts in surface transportation spending were $343 billion for roads, highways, bridges and motor safety, $109 billion for transit, and $95 billion for rail. Provisions of the bill incentivized prioritizing maintenance and repair spending over spending on new infrastructure, holistically planning for all modes of transport when considering how to connect job centers to housing (including collecting data on reductions in vehicle miles traveled through transit-oriented development), and lowering speed limits to increase road safety and encourage building complete streets. The Senate version, and the final bill, de-emphasized these incentives.\n\nProvisions\nThe final version restores the Superfund excise tax on certain chemicals which expired in 1995.\n\nOverview\nAccording to NPR, the version which passed the Senate on July 28 was set to include:\n\n$110 billion for roads, bridges and other major projects;\n$11 billion for transportation safety programs;\n$39 billion to modernize transit and improve accessibility;\n$66 billion for passenger and freight rail;\n$7.5 billion to build a national network of electric vehicle chargers;\n$73 billion to overhaul the nation's power infrastructure, clean energy transmission, and overall energy policy;\n$65 billion for broadband development.\nThe law would also make the Minority Business Development Agency a permanent agency. It authorizes the DOT to create an organization called the Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Infrastructure (ARPA\u2013I), with a broad remit over transportation research akin to DARPA, HSARPA, IARPA, ARPA-E, and ARPA-H, with the first appropriations of $3.22 million being made in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. Lastly, it broadens the powers of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, to provide faster conflict resolution among agencies, in speeding up infrastructure design approvals.\n\nImpact on environment and climate\nAn October 2021 report written by the REPEAT Project, a partnership between the Evolved Energy Research firm and Princeton University's ZERO Lab, said the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act alone will make only a small reduction in emissions, but as they say:We lack modeling capabilities to reflect the net effect of surface transportation investments in highways (which tend to increase on-road vehicle and freight miles traveled) and rail and public transit (which tend to reduce on-road vehicle and freight miles traveled). These significant programs are therefore not modeled in this analysis, an important limitation of our assessment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.The Georgetown Climate Center tried to estimate how the $599 billion investment for surface transportation in the law can impact emissions from transportation. It created two scenarios: \"high emissions\" and \"low emissions\". In the first scenario, from the money dedicated to highways, more money will go to building new highways, while in the second, more will go to repairing existing highways. The other spending areas characteristics are not so different. The first scenario sees increased cumulative emissions over the years 2022\u20132040 by more than 200 million tons, while the second decreases them by around 250 million tons.\nIn August 2022, the Boston Consulting Group analyzed the Act and found $41 billion of it would be spent on energy projects germane to climate action, $18 billion on similarly germane transportation projects, $18 billion on \"clean tech\" intended to cut hard-to-abate emissions, $0 on manufacturing, and $34 billion on other climate action provisions.\nThe law includes the largest federal investment in public transit in history. The law includes spending figures of $105 billion in public transport. It also spends $110 billion on fixing roads and bridges and includes measures for climate change mitigation and improving access for cyclists and pedestrians. Increasing use of public transport and related transit-oriented development can reduce transportation emissions in human settlements by 78% and overall US emissions by 15%.\nThe law includes spending:\n\n$21 billion for environmental projects\n$50 billion for water storage\n$15 billion for electric vehicles\n$73 billion to overhaul the energy policy of the United States.\n$4.7 billion to cap orphan wells abandoned by oil and gas companies\n$1 billion to better connect neighborhoods separated by transport infrastructure as part of environmental justice efforts. This $1 billion will be spent through the Reconnecting Communities Pilot (RCP) discretionary grant program that, among other priorities, promotes:\nNew or improved, affordable transportation options to increase safe mobility and connectivity for all, including for people with disabilities, through lower-carbon travel like walking, cycling, rolling, and transit that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote active travel.\n\nEnergy\n$73 billion will be spent on overhauling the energy policy of the United States. The Boston Consulting Group projects $41 billion of the Act will be germane to climate action in energy. $11 billion of the $73 billion amount will be invested in the electrical grid's adjustment to renewable energy, with some of the money going to new loans for electric power transmission lines and required studies for future transmission needs. $6 billion of that $73 billion will go to domestic nuclear power. Also of that $73 billion, the IIJA invests $45 billion in innovation and industrial policy for key emerging technologies in energy; $430 million\u2013$21 billion in new demonstration projects at the DOE; and nearly $24 billion in onshoring, supply chain resilience, and bolstering U.S.-held competitive advantages in energy; the latter amount will be divided into an $8.6 billion investment in carbon capture and storage, $3 billion in battery material reprocessing, $3 billion in battery recycling, $1 billion in rare-earth minerals stockpiling, and $8 billion in new research hubs for green hydrogen. The DOE has imposed grant requirements on $7 billion of the IIJA's battery and transportation spending, which are meant to promote community benefits agreements, social justice, and formation of trade unions. It created the $225 million Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation program for cities, tribes and counties to revise building codes for electrical and heating work. Finally, the law gives $4.7 billion to cap orphan wells abandoned by oil and gas companies.\n\nBroadband\nThe law invests a total of $65 billion in advancing the U.S. quest for broadband universal service. Of this $65 billion, the law invests $42.45 billion in a new infrastructure grant program by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration called the  Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, with highest priority going to communities with Internet speeds below 25 downstream and 3 upstream Mbps. $2 billion will go to the NTIA's Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program, $1 billion to a new middle mile infrastructure program, $1.44 billion in formula grants to state and territorial digital equity plan implementation, $60 million in formula grants to new digital equity plan development, and $1.25 billion in discretionary grants to \"specific types of political subdivisions to implement digital equity projects\".\nThe law gives the USDA $5.5 billion of the $65 billion total to deliver broadband to rural communities smaller than 20,000 people, $5 million of which is obligated to utility cooperatives.\nThe law invests $14.2 billion of the total in the Federal Communications Commission's Affordable Connectivity Program, the successor to the American Rescue Plan's broadband subsidies. It gives a $30 monthly discount on internet services to qualifying low-income families ($75 on tribal lands), and provides a $100 discount on tablets, laptops and desktops for them. The program ran out of funds on April 30, 2024. The law also requires the FCC to return consumer broadband labels it developed in 2016 to statute, to revise its public comment process and to issue rules and model policies for combating digital deployment discrimination, with the United States Attorney General's cooperation, and the Government Accountability Office to deliver a report on updating broadband thresholds by November 2022.\n\nWater\nTo support safe drinking water programs, the law provides:\n\n$11.7 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF)\n$15 billion to local water systems for lead service line replacement\n$9 billion to address emerging contaminants such as PFAS ($4 billion through the SRF and $5 billion through grants to water utilities)\n$3.5 billion to build water and sewer systems for the Indian Health Service.\nFor surface water programs, such as watershed management and pollution control, the law provides:\n\n$12.7 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to support state and local government water quality programs\n$1.7 billion for geographic-based programs including the National Estuary Program, the Great Lakes program and the Chesapeake Bay Program.\n\nAddressing drought in Western states\nThe Act provides $8 billion for helping Western states deal with the Southwestern North American megadrought. Spending for many related projects is included under the category \"Western Water Infrastructure\".\n\nBridges\nPrior to the enactment of the infrastructure law in 2021, no dedicated federal bridge funding had existed since fiscal year 2013. The law created two new programs specifically to fund bridge projects:\n\nBridge Formula Program (BFP)\nWith $27.5 billion over five years, the BFP distributes funds to every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico based on a formula that accounts for each state's cost to replace or rehabilitate its poor or fair condition bridges. Each state is guaranteed a minimum of $45 million per year from this program. At least 15% of each state's funds must be spent on off-system bridges (i.e., public bridges that are not on federal-aid highways), and 3% is set aside each year for bridges on tribal lands. Off-system and tribal bridge projects may be funded with a 100% federal share (as opposed to the standard 80% federal share).\n\nBridge Investment Program (BIP)\nWith $12.5 billion over five years, the BIP is a competitive grant program to replace, rehabilitate, preserve, or make resiliency improvements to bridges. Half of the funding is reserved for large bridge projects, which are defined as projects that cost over $100 million. Large projects are funded at a maximum 50% federal share, while other projects are funded at a maximum 80% federal share.\n\nPassenger rail\nThe infrastructure law is the largest investment in passenger rail since the 1971 creation of Amtrak (which under the law will receive $22 billion in advance appropriations and $19 billion in fully authorized funds). It directly appropriated $66 billion for rail over a five-year period (including the Amtrak appropriations), of which at least $18 billion is designated for expanding passenger rail service to new corridors, and it authorized an additional $36 billion. Most of this funding for new passenger rail lines is implemented through the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail program, which will receive $36 billion in advance appropriations and $7.5 billion in fully authorized funds. The Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements program will receive $5 billion in advance appropriations and $5 billion in fully authorized funds, while programs for grade separation replacing level crossings will receive $3 billion in advance appropriations and $2.5 billion in fully authorized funds, and the Restoration and Enhancement Grant program intended to revive discontinued passenger rail services will receive $250 million in advance appropriations and $250 million in fully authorized funds. Per the law's requirements, at least $12 billion is available and $3.4\u20134.1 billion authorized for expanding service outside of the Northeast Corridor, and $24 billion is available and $3.4\u20134.1 billion authorized to partially rebuild the Corridor.\nTo help plan and guide the expansion of passenger rail service beyond the Northeast Corridor, the infrastructure law also created a $1.8 billion Corridor Identification and Development Program. The law also expands eligibility for a potential $23 billion in transit funding to these corridors and changes the allocation methods for state government-supported passenger rail shorter than 750 miles, to encourage states to implement more such service.\n\nTransit station accessibility\nThe law established and authorized $1.75 billion over five years for a new All Stations Accessibility Program (ASAP). This program is designed to improve the accessibility of rail system stations that were built before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). At the time of the infrastructure law's passage, over 900 transit stations were not fully ADA-compliant.\n\nHighway removal and complete streets\nThe law includes $1 billion over five years for Reconnecting Communities planning and construction grants intended to build marginalized community-recommended projects removing or capping highways and railroads, the first $185 million of which were awarded to 45 projects on February 28, 2023. The program was later combined with the Neighborhood Equity and Access program from the Inflation Reduction Act for efficiency reasons, before the next 132 projects were given $3.3 billion in awards on March 13, 2024.\n\nCharging stations\nThe Act creates the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program within the Department of Energy. It provides funding of up to $4.155 billion to state governments for up to 80 percent of eligible project costs, to add substantial open-access electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure along major highway corridors.\n\nVehicle safety\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to develop a safety mechanism to prevent drunk driving, which causes about 10,000 deaths each year in the United States as of 2021, which will be rolled out in phases for retroactive fitting, and will become mandatory for all new vehicles in 2027. The technology, which is being developed by NHTSA in cooperation with the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety and Swedish automobile safety company Autoliv, consists of a breath-based and a touch-based sensor that stops the car if the driver is above the legal blood alcohol content, and will be open-sourced to automobile manufacturers.\nUnder the law, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) will be required to develop regulations for a system that can detect distracted, fatigued, or impaired drivers. The NHTSA has recommended implementing a camera-based warning system for the former, similar to a technology mandated by the European Union in July 2022.\nThe law also requires the NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program to test collision avoidance systems in preparation for new federal regulations; new DOT reporting requirements for statistical data on crashes involving motorized scooters and electric bicycles; new federal regulations on headlamps; research directives on technology to protect pedestrians and cyclists, advanced driver-assistance systems, federal hood and bumper regulations, smart city infrastructure, and self-driving cars; and a new Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) office specializing in cybersecurity.\n\nWildlife crossings and conservation\nThe infrastructure law created the Wildlife Crossings Pilot Program with $350 million in funding over five years. This is a competitive grant program that funds planning and construction projects that prevent wildlife-vehicle collisions and improve the connectivity of animal habitats.\nThe law also allocated $1 billion to create the National Culvert Removal, Replacement, and Restoration Grant program to improve the passage of anadromous fish such as salmon.\n\nImplementation and results\nBiden's infrastructure advisor and the staffer in charge of implementing the law has been identified as Mitch Landrieu. Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has been identified as the staffer in charge of ensuring the law does not conflict with American foreign policy interests. To support the implementation of the Act, Biden issued Executive Order 14052, which establishes a task force comprising most of his Cabinet. Biden appointed Landrieu and then-United States National Economic Council chief Brian Deese as the task force co-chairs.\nIn May 2022, the Biden administration published a manual on the use of the law, aimed mainly at local authorities. The manual briefly describes the over 350 programs included in the law. Each description includes the aim of the program, its funding and possible recipients, its period of availability, and more. The programs are grouped into four categories: \"Transportation\", \"Climate, Energy and the Environment\", \"Broadband\", and \"Other Programs\".\nBy the law's second anniversary in November 2023, around $400 billion from the law, about a third of all IIJA funding, was allocated to more than 40,000 projects related to infrastructure, transport, and sustainability. By May 2024, the law's halfway mark, the numbers had increased to $454 billion (38 percent of the Act's funds) for more than 56,000 projects, and by the third anniversary in November 2024, they had increased to $568 billion (47 percent) to 68,000 projects, leaving 53 percent of IIJA funds unallocated but showing the administration had been accelerating funding approvals. Public attention has remained relatively low, due in part to slow implementation of projects.\nThe White House offers a \"Map of Progress\" which tracks all spending that resulted from the act.\n\nMacroeconomic impact\nAccording to the New Democrat-linked think tank Center for American Progress, the IIJA, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act have together catalyzed over 35,000 public and private investments.  Economists Noah Smith and Joseph Politano credited the three acts together for spurring booms in factory construction and utility jobs, as well as limiting geographic concentrations of key industries to ensure more dispersed job creation nationwide, though they raised issues of whether the three would serve to limit project delays and significantly increase labor productivity in the long term. The Biden administration itself claimed that as of January 10, 2025, the IIJA, CaSA, and IRA together catalyzed $1 trillion in private investment (including $449 billion in electronics and semiconductors, $184 billion in electric vehicles and batteries, $215 billion in clean power, $93 billion in clean energy tech manufacturing and infrastructure, and $51 billion in heavy industry) and over $756.2 billion in public infrastructure spending (including $99 billion in energy aside from tax credits in the IRA).\n\nEnergy and industry\nIn September 2023, White House data revealed that 60 percent of the Act's energy and transmission funding (up to that point, totaling $12.31 billion) had been awarded to states that voted majority Republican in the 2020 election cycle. Of the Act's top ten recipients, seven states had voted majority Republican, with Wyoming ($1.95 billion) and Texas ($1.71 billion) in the lead. The largest single energy project to receive Act funds was a Generation IV reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming by the nuclear fission startup TerraPower.\nIn November 2022, the Biden administration announced it would furnish $550 million for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program for clean energy generators for low-income and minority communities, the first such appropriation since the Recovery Act in 2009. The administration announced the competitive portion would award $8.8 million to 12 communities on October 12, 2023, with the next award applications due in April (later changed to October) 2024. By June 28, 2024, the seventh tranche of funding had been awarded from the EECBG program, totaling about $150 million for 175 communities, with that date's instance seeing $18.5 million awarded to four states and 20 communities.\nIn April 2023, the Biden administration announced it would award $450 million from the Act to projects that built solar farms on abandoned coal mines. Further support for coal communities followed. In November 2023 the IIJA's Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains announced $275 million in grants would go to seven projects in coal communities, creating 1,500 jobs and leveraging $600 million in private investment. The next October it announced $428 million in grants for 14 projects in coal communities, creating 1,900 jobs and leveraging $500 million in private investments.\nOn July 12, 2023, the Biden administration announced it would award $90 million from the Act's Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation program to 27 cities and counties to update building energy codes. On March 4, 2024 the DOE announced $90 million more would be awarded from the program later that October.\nOn October 24, 2023, the administration announced the first $3.46 billion in Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships grants from the Act's $11 billion grid rebuilding authorization, would go to 58 projects in 44 states. A majority are categorized for smart grid projects and eight are categorized as pursuing grid innovation. The investment is the largest in the American grid since the Recovery Act 14 years earlier. According to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, the projects could enable 35 gigawatts of renewable energy to come online by 2030, $8 billion in investments to be catalyzed, and 400 microgrids to be built. On August 6, 2024, the DOE announced the recipients of the next $2.2 billion in GRIP grants, eight grid innovation projects across 18 states adding a total of 13 gigawatts of capacity to the grid and catalyzing $10 billion in investments. On October 18, 2024, the DOE announced nearly $2 billion more in GRIP grants would be awarded to 38 smaller projects in 42 states and the District of Columbia, altogether adding 7.5 gigawatts of capacity to the grid and catalyzing nearly $4.2 billion in investment.\nOn October 30, 2023, the DOE announced the results of a mandated triennial study that, for the first time in its history, included anticipation of future grid transmission needs; the Act had explicitly required this inclusion. The study found fewer infrastructure investments since 2015 and consistently high prices in the Rust Belt and California since 2018, and projected a 20 to 128 percent increase in transmission would be needed within regions, while interregional transmission would need to increase by 25 to 412 percent. The DOE found the most potential was in better connecting Texas to the Southwest region, the Mississippi Delta and Midwest regions to the Great Plains region, and New York to New England. The DOE also announced the first three recipients of a new $2.5 billion loan program called the Transmission Facilitation Program, created to provide funding to help build up the interstate power grid. They are a line between Quebec, New Hampshire and Vermont, a line between Utah and Nevada; and a line between Arizona and New Mexico. The following April 25, the TFP announced the selection of an extension of the One Nevada Transmission Line northward to Idaho. The next October, the DOE announced that four projects in Maine, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and between Texas and Mississippi, were being awarded a total of $1.5 billion under the TFP; the DOE also released its first ever National Transmission Planning Study to follow up on the Needs Study, forecasting a needed national transmission capacity increase of 2.4 to 3.5 times the 2020 level by 2050 to keep costs low and facilitate the energy transmission, with estimated cost savings ranging from $270 billion to $490 billion.\nOn November 16, 2023, the Biden administration announced the first recipients of $40.8 million in grants from a workforce training program the Act created, which will provide skills for industrial technology, the building trades and energy auditing. In December 2023 the DOE fulfilled the IIJA's requirement that the designation process for National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors be revised.\nOn January 17, 2024, more than $104 million were allocated to 31 projects which are expected to increase energy conservation and clean energy use in federal facilities and save $29 million in their first years. The projects advance, among other technologies, heat recovery ventilation, heat pumps, building insulation, and solar thermal panels. On February 13, the Biden administration announced that Chevron Corporation and Fervo Energy would receive $74 million under the law to begin demonstrating the efficacy of enhanced geothermal systems, at a site near The Geysers, California for Chevron, and a site near Milford, Utah for Fervo. On February 27, the Department of Energy announced that under the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas program, 17 projects in rural areas across 20 states and 30 tribal communities had been approved to receive $366 million in grants to decarbonize and densify their grids. A majority of approved projects involved installation of solar panels, grid battery storage, and microgrids.\nOn March 21, the Biden administration announced that five projects in Arizona, Nevada, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania would receive $475 million from the Act, to build solar and geothermal power plants and energy storage on current and former mine lands. On March 25, 2024, the Biden administration announced the first 33 grant recipients of the Department of Energy's $6 billion Industrial Demonstrations Program to reduce embedded emissions in factories and materials processing, of which the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds $489 million. Cement and concrete industry projects received $1.5 billion in total, steelmaking projects received $1.5 billion, and chemical engineering and refinery projects $1.2 billion. The Biden administration expects these projected to drive 1.4 million tons in carbon emissions cuts; however, most of the grants had yet to be finalized by November 11. On April 30, the Department of Energy announced 19 more recipients across 12 states and 13 tribal communities, of $78 million in award grants from the Act's Energy Improvements in Remote or Rural Areas program, with a majority of projects involving solar power.\nOn May 13, 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission published Order No. 1977, clarifying a provision in the Act by stating that the Commission has 'backstop siting authority' in case a state agency neglects to hand out a construction permit for a new transmission project.\nOn September 5, 2024, the Energy Department announced the awarding of over $430 million in incentives to 293 existing hydroelectricity projects, under the Act's Section 40333. On September 20, the DOE announced it would award $3 billion to, and leverage $13 billion in investments in, 25 battery manufacturing and supply chain projects, more than half of which had pledged Project Labor Agreements. 12,000 new jobs across 14 states were projected for creation.\nIn December 2024, the DOE announced that the first three new NIETCs under the IIJA's process would move closer toward full eligibility for TFP funds under the Act's new process, a corridor on the bed of Lake Erie between Ontario and Pennsylvania, a connector between Colorado, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and a connector between the Dakotas. Notably, the sponsor of the Kansas-Indiana Grain Belt Express requested that it be taken off the eligibility list because they had likely secured enough funding to do so.\n\nHydrogen hubs\nThe Biden administration awarded $7 billion of the $8 billion appropriation to seven hydrogen research hubs, based in California, eastern Washington, southeastern Pennsylvania, southeastern Texas, Illinois, Minnesota, and West Virginia and affecting projects there and in eight more states, on October 13, 2023. The remaining $1 billion will be used for demand-side economic policies to drive growth in hydrogen use.\nSeveral criticisms of the hubs emerged. Jeff St. John, editor in chief of Canary Media, noted while it does mandate that the DOE create a clean hydrogen definitional standard (which as of October 2023 the DOE had not published), and that the DOE selected applicants who pledged community benefits agreements, the Act does not prescribe metrics or guidelines for measuring emissions from these hubs. Researcher Hannah Story Brown of the watchdog group Revolving Door Project noted that the majority of hub projects announced are powered by fossil fuels, not renewable energy. Staffers for California Governor Gavin Newsom requested that the Treasury Department exempt the state's hub from emissions restrictions, citing poor alignment with the state's plans for 100% renewable energy.\nOn the first anniversary of the October 2023 announcement, St. John reported that the Californian, Washingtonian, and West Virginian hub collaboratives were the farthest along in working towards finalizing their funding, and the DOE's Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was optimistic, but also that all projects were lagging behind in transparency and community outreach, with several projects seeing corporate partners withdraw. Jael Holzman of the outlet Heatmap News reported that soon after, experts in energy markets pointed at a lack of coordination between the Hub program and the IRA's hydrogen tax credits, price increases for electrolyzers, and the historically low cost of natural gas as additional reasons for the withdrawal of investment in Hub projects.\nLater in 2024, the DOE selected the hubs based in California, Washington, Illinois, Texas and West Virginia for near-final deals that together would cost a total $5.3 billion. The final two hubs based in Minnesota and Pennsylvania were not far behind in negotiations.\n\nDirect air capture hubs\nThe Act appropriates $3.5 billion to a new Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program as part of its $8.6 billion carbon capture and storage investment. In August 2023, the DOE selected two projects (leaving two more to be selected), together worth $1.2 billion:\n\nThe South Texas Hub in Kleberg County, Texas, run by Carbon Engineering, Occidental Petroleum and Worley Group.\nProject Cypress in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, run by Battelle Memorial Institute, Climeworks and Heirloom Carbon Technologies.\nThe projects together will remove 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and create 4,800 jobs.\nIn September 2024, the DOE announced it intended to fund up to $1.8 billion more in direct air capture projects, with the full solicitation released on December 17.\n\nBroadband\nBy April 2024, the Affordable Connectivity Program had seen 23 million households enroll in it. As of June 2024, the program has ended.\n\nWater\nIn May 2024, the Biden administration announced $3 billion in funding from the law had been allotted to replace lead water pipes.\n\nTransportation\nThe bill contains $27 billion in funding for specific, concrete programs within the Federal Highway Administration that are already implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, all of which was allotted in November 2023. For example, $7.2 billion is allocated to the \"Transportation Alternatives Set-Aside Program\" (creating more possibilities for biking and walking), $6.4 billion to the \"Carbon Reduction Program\" (reducing emissions from highways), $69 million to the \"Transit-Oriented Development Program\" (enhancing transit-oriented development and improving land use) and more. However, because states have wide discretion over use of funds from other highway programs under the Act, which leads to states with fast population growth investing more in highway expansion, the Act has been projected by Transportation for America to increase carbon emissions by 77 million metric tonnes by 2040 compared to a no-Act baseline.\nOn December 4, the Department of Energy released a proposed rule clarifying the definition of \"foreign entities of concern\" under the Act's car battery materials provisions, in line with the Inflation Reduction Act's Section 30D.\nOn December 8, the Biden administration announced it would award $8.2 billion from the Act's Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program to ten construction projects, including Brightline West, the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor, the Keystone Corridor, California High-Speed Rail, the Downeaster and Empire Builder services, a partial rebuilding of Chicago Union Station, and a bridge replacement near Willow on the Alaska Railroad. It also announced the first results of the Act's Corridor ID Program, with $34.5 million being distributed to 15 existing rail upgrades, 47 extensions of rail corridors, and 7 new high-speed rail studies.\nThe bill included $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging. As of December 2024, 37 charging stations with a total of 226 spots for charging vehicles had been built.\nOn April 2, 2024, an award announcement was made for the transit-oriented development program, which was expanded under the Act.\n\nEcosystems\nIn 2023 an agreement between seven states was achieved, aiming to preserve the Colorado River water system from collapse due to poor management and climate change. The United States is heavily dependent on the river for power generation, drinking water, agriculture, wildlands restoration, and native cultural practices. Some states will reduce water use, receiving compensation for it (totaling $1.2 billion) from the federal government. Many other projects for preserving the river such as water recycling and rainwater harvesting, are advanced. The funding comes from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nIn February 2024, $157 million was allocated to 206 projects linked to ecosystem restoration. The projects are spread all over the territory of the United States and are advanced in cooperation with states, tribes, nonprofits and territories. More than half of them benefit underserved communities. The projects include cleaning up pollution, restoring Central U.S. grasslands including bison populations, protecting birds in Hawaii from extinction, stopping invasive species, restoring salmon populations in Alaska, restoring sagebrush steppes and more. On this occasion United States Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland remarked, \"Nature is our best ally in the fight against climate change.\"\n\nClimate adaptation\nThe bill provides around $7 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for helping communities adapt to different climate-related disasters such as hurricanes, droughts, and heat waves. In August 2023, $3 billion was allocated to different related projects, including 124 projects related to resilient infrastructure and communities (located in \"38 states, one tribe and the District of Columbia\") and 149 projects related to protection from flooding (located in \"28 states and the District of Columbia\"). From the projects related to infrastructure, 64 use nature-based solutions. Some of the most vulnerable communities will receive help for free.\nIn November 2023, the Biden administration announced that $300 million from FEMA's new Swift Current Initiative created by the Act would go to helping communities impacted by floods recover and grow their resiliency. It also announced that it would award \"$50 million in project awards to improve the reliability of water resources and support ecosystem health in Western states, along with an additional $50 million funding opportunity for water conservation projects and hydropower upgrades.\"\nIn March 2024, $120 million was delivered to help indigenous peoples in the U.S. adapt to climate change. Of this number, $26 million was allocated from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The efforts will include planning, ecosystem management and restoration, planned relocation, and promotion and use of indigenous knowledge.\n\nTrump administration actions and the courts\nIn January 2025, the incoming Trump administration froze selected IIJA grants. However, that April, federal judge Mary McElroy ruled on a case brought by Rhode Island conservation groups that the IIJA grants had to be unfrozen, citing constitutionality concerns.\n\nBy state\nFlorida\nAround $1.1 billion was allocated for restoration of the Everglades ecosystems. In March 2024, Marco Rubio, supported by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, demanded $725 million more, as the rising levels of water in the Lake Okeechobee created additional problems.\n\nWisconsin\nIn October 2023, $450 million (including $275 million from the bill) was delivered to clean the Milwaukee River estuary of Polychlorinated biphenyl, heavy metals, and oil products. This pollution had negative effects on surrounding communities for a long time. This is the most funding ever distributed by a Great Lakes cleanup program.\n\nReactions\nCongress\nRepublican senators balked at Biden's tandem plan to pass both a bipartisan plan and a separate Democratic-supported reconciliation bill. McConnell criticized Biden for \"caving\" to his own party by issuing an \"ultimatum\" that he would not sign the bipartisan bill without a separate reconciliation package. After Biden walked back his comments, Republican senators restated their confidence in the bipartisan bill. A Yahoo! News/YouGov poll conducted in late June found that 60% of Republican voters favored the plan.\nOn June 20, 2021, Senator Bernie Sanders stated that he would not support paying for the bill via a proposed gas tax or a surcharge on electric vehicles.\nOn June 28, 2021, Sunrise Movement and several progressive representatives performed a protest at the White House in criticism of the size and scope of Biden's Civilian Climate Corps. Several protesters were arrested for blocking White House entrances.\nOn July 6, the 58-member bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus stated their support for the bipartisan bill and called for an expeditious and independent House vote. On July 21, a group of 65 former governors and mayors endorsed the plan.\nAhead of a procedural vote on August 7, former president Donald Trump attacked the bill and said he would support Republican primary challengers of senators who vote for it. He reiterated his criticisms following the bill's passage by Congress.\nFollowing the bill's passage by Congress in November, Trump criticized it as containing \"only 11% for real Infrastructure\", calling it \"the Elect Democrats in 2022/24 Act\", and attacked Republicans who had supported it, saying in particular that McConnell had lent \"lifelines to those who are destroying\" the country. Various House Republicans also criticized the 13 Republican representatives who voted for the bill. Lauren Boebert described them as \"RINOS\" (Republican in Name Only). Mary Miller called them \"spineless\" and said they helped enact a \"socialist takeover\". Marjorie Taylor Greene called them \"traitors\" and \"American job & energy killers\", who \"are China-First and America-Last\", because they \"agree with Globalist Joe [Biden] that America must depend on China to drive\" electric vehicles. Gary Palmer was criticized for touting funding for the Birmingham Northern Beltline that he added to the bill, while neglecting to mention that he voted against the final bill. Paul Gosar was also criticized for taking credit for the bill's funding for Kingman Airport despite voting against it. Several Republican governors who condemned the bill, including Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Greg Gianforte of Montana, accepted the funding and directed it to various programs.\n\nOthers\nOn June 22, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable and No Labels made a joint statement urging the president to consider a bipartisan bill. The former two groups have lobbied for the plan not to raise corporate taxes, and to instead impose user fees and borrow from other federal funds.\nAccording to an early August Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll survey, about 72% of voters support the bill.\nOn September 24, leaders from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the National Urban League, and other Black American advocacy groups signaled their support for the bill.\nOn September 25, Peter J. Wallison authored an opinion piece for The Hill in which he argued that Republicans should try to pass the bipartisan bill to prevent it from being used as further leverage to pass the reconciliation bill. Subsequently, Republican House leaders formally opposed the bipartisan bill.\n\"Historians, economists and engineers interviewed by The Associated Press welcomed Biden's efforts. But they stressed that $1 trillion was not nearly enough to overcome the government's failure for decades to maintain and upgrade the country's infrastructure.\"\nThe think tank Transportation for America praised the House version of the bill, but heavily criticized the Senate version for its shortcomings on safety, climate resilience, long-term transit and rail funding and transit-oriented development, and maintenance spending, though it later noted that the final version that became law made small steps to address them.\nThe nuclear industry favored the legislation as it signaled continued federal government support.\nPolling from Third Way and Impact Research released in July 2022 showed that only 24% of voters were aware the bill was signed into law, despite House Democrats holding over 1,000 events to promote it.\nReception to the drunk driver detection and distraction detection requirements have been mixed. Mothers Against Drunk Driving praised the requirement as \"the beginning of the end of drunk driving\". In contrast, the American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern that the technology developed could pose a severe privacy risk to drivers if it collects or stores unnecessary data. Writing for Vice, Aaron Gordon also argued that the technology is likely to have an unacceptably high false-positive rate \u2014 existing ignition interlock devices that are sometimes installed after drunk driving convictions are prone to catastrophic failures.\nIn October 2023, the Natural Resources Defense Council criticized the IIJA's hydrogen hubs program for its lack of transparency, emphasizing the need for detailed technical reports, public hearings to thwart local NIMBYism and skepticism of hydrogen, and incorporation of environmental justice advocates into project leadership.\n\nSee also\nCHIPS and Science Act of 2022\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\nInfrastructure policy of Donald Trump\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act as amended (PDF/details) in the GPO Statute Compilations collection\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act as enacted (PDF/details) in the US Statutes at Large\nH.R. 3684 on Congress.gov\nBIL Maps Dashboard, General Services Administration database displaying geographic information on IIJA projects as of May 26, 2023. Retrieved June 29, 2023.", "summary": "The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), (H.R. 3684) is a United States federal statute enacted by the 117th United States Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden on November 15, 2021. It was introduced in the House as the INVEST in America Act and nicknamed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. The act was initially a $547\u2013715 billion infrastructure package that included provisions related to federal highway aid, transit, highway safety, motor carrier, research, hazardous materials and rail programs of the Department of Transportation. After congressional negotiations, it was amended and renamed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to add funding for broadband access, clean water and electric grid renewal in addition to the transportation and road proposals of the original House bill. This amended version included approximately $1.2 trillion in spending, with $550 billion newly authorized spending on top of what Congress was planning to authorize regularly.\nThe amended bill was passed 69\u201330 by the Senate on August 10, 2021. On November 5, it was passed 228\u2013206 by the House, and ten days later was signed into law by President Biden.", "citation": "WIKI58094", "id": "WIKI58094", "type": "Wikipedia", "doc_id": "58094", "source_document": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act", "source_dataset": "Wikipedia", "topics": "", "active": true, "date": "2025-06-08", "text": "**Title**: Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\n**Report ID:** WIKI58094\n\n**Publication Date:**: 2025-06-08\n\n- **Background** `[WIKI58094__1___1]`:\n - On March 31, 2021, President Joe Biden unveiled his $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan (which, when combined with the American Families Plan, amounted to $4 trillion in infrastructure spending), pitched by him as \"a transformative effort to overhaul the nation's economy\". The detailed plan aimed to create millions of jobs, bolster labor unions, expand labor protections, and address climate change.\n- **Legislative history** `[WIKI58094__2___1]`:\n\n  - **Senate passage** `[WIKI58094__2___2]`:\n   - In mid-April 2021, Republican lawmakers offered a $568 billion counterproposal to the American Jobs Plan. On May 9, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said it should cost no more than $800 billion. On May 21, the administration reduced the price tag to $1.7 trillion, which was quickly rejected by Republicans. A day later, a bipartisan group within the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee announced that they had reached a deal for $304 billion in U.S. highway funding. This was approved unanimously by the committee on May 26. On June 4, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Peter DeFazio announced a $547 billion plan, called the INVEST in America Act, which would address parts of the American Jobs Plan. On July 1, the House passed an amended $715 billion infrastructure bill focused on land transportation and water.\n   - On May 27, Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito presented a $928 billion plan, and on June 4, increased it by about $50 billion; this was quickly rejected by the Biden administration. On June 8, the administration shifted its focus to a bipartisan group of 20 senators, which had been working on a package tentatively priced around $900 billion. On June 10, a bipartisan group of 10 senators reached a deal costing $974 billion over five years; or about $1.2 trillion if stretched over eight years. On June 16, the plan was endorsed by a bipartisan group of 21 senators. On June 24, the bipartisan group met with the president and reached a compromise deal costing $1.2 trillion over eight years, which focuses on physical infrastructure (notably roads, bridges, railways, water, sewage, broadband, electric vehicles). This was planned to be paid for through reinforced Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collection, unspent COVID-19 relief funds, and other sources. By July 2021, the IRS portion of the funding had reportedly been scrapped. Biden stipulated that a separate \"human infrastructure\" bill (notably child care, home care, and climate change) \u2013 later known as the Build Back Better Act \u2013 must also pass, whether through bipartisanship or reconciliation, but later walked back this position. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi similarly stated that the House would not vote on the physical infrastructure bill until the larger bill passes in the Senate, despite the fact that reconciliation overrides much of the obstructive power of the filibuster.\n   - White House officials stated on July 7 that legislative text was nearing completion. On July 14, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced an energy bill expected to be included in the bipartisan package. On July 21, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer put forward a \"shell bill\" for a vote to kick off debate in the Senate, intending to add the bipartisan text via an amendment. On July 25, Republican senator Rob Portman stated that an agreement was \"about 90%\" complete, with mass transit being one remaining point of contention. On July 30, Portman stated that this had been resolved. On July 28, Senator Kyrsten Sinema stated that she did not support a reconciliation bill costing $3.5 trillion, breaking the stalemate and allowing the bipartisan bill to move forward. That day, the Senate voted 67\u201332 to advance the bill, and on July 30, voted 66\u201328 to proceed to its consideration. The legislation text was completed and substituted into the bill on August 1. On August 5, Schumer moved to truncate debate on the legislation, setting up a procedural vote on August 7, which passed 67\u201327. Fifteen or more amendments were expected to receive votes through the weekend. On August 10, the bill was passed by the Senate 69\u201330. It sets aside $550 billion in new spending.\n   - A procedural vote on a House rule concerning passing both bills passed along party lines on August 24.\n  - **House passage** `[WIKI58094__2___3]`:\n   - In early August, nine moderate Democrats called for an immediate House vote on the bill, citing a desire not to lose the momentum from the Senate passage of the bill. They committed to voting against taking up the reconciliation resolution until there was a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill. While both Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had reversed earlier positions to support passing the bipartisan bill separately, progressives including Congressional Progressive Caucus chairwoman Pramila Jayapal and Senator Bernie Sanders maintained that it be utilized as leverage to pass the most expensive reconciliation bill possible. The lack of a deal caused a late September House vote to be postponed. On October 2, Pelosi set a new deadline of October 31. By October 28, Jayapal and other progressive leaders indicated that they were willing to vote on the bill separately, but Sanders and others opposed this. On October 31, a majority of progressives signaled that they would support both bills.\n   - Votes on both bills were considered on November 5, but the hesitation of several moderates to pass the reconciliation bill before it could be scored by the Congressional Budget Office made passing the bipartisan bill unlikely.  Negotiations between centrist and progressive Democrats concluded with the centrists committing to passing the Build Back Better Act. The bill ultimately went to a vote, as did a rule to vote on the larger bill once it was scored, passing 228\u2013206; 13 Republicans joined all but six Democrats (members of \"the Squad\") in supporting the legislation. The six Democrats who voted 'No' stated that their opposition was because the legislation had been decoupled from the social-safety net provisions of the Build Back Better bill. Biden signed the bill into law at a signing ceremony on November 15.\n- **Original version of the IIJA** `[WIKI58094__3___1]`:\n - The following is the bill summary authorized by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) for the INVEST in America Act, the original version which passed the House on July 1, 2021:\n - \"extends FY2021 enacted levels through FY2022 for federal-aid highway, transit, and safety programs;\n - reauthorizes for FY2023-FY2026 several surface transportation programs, including the federal-aid highway program, transit programs, highway safety, motor carrier safety, and rail programs;\n - addresses climate change, including strategies to reduce the climate change impacts of the surface transportation system and a vulnerability assessment to identify opportunities to enhance the resilience of the surface transportation system and ensure the efficient use of federal resources;\n - revises Buy America Act procurement requirements for highways, mass transit, and rail;\n - establishes a rural bridge rebuilding program to improve the safety and state of good repair of bridges in rural communities;\n - implements new safety requirements across all transportation modes; and\n - directs the Department of Transportation to establish a pilot program to demonstrate a national motor vehicle per-mile user fee to restore and maintain the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund and achieve and maintain a state of good repair in the surface transportation system.\"\n - The specific amounts in surface transportation spending were $343 billion for roads, highways, bridges and motor safety, $109 billion for transit, and $95 billion for rail. Provisions of the bill incentivized prioritizing maintenance and repair spending over spending on new infrastructure, holistically planning for all modes of transport when considering how to connect job centers to housing (including collecting data on reductions in vehicle miles traveled through transit-oriented development), and lowering speed limits to increase road safety and encourage building complete streets. The Senate version, and the final bill, de-emphasized these incentives.\n- **Provisions** `[WIKI58094__4___1]`:\n - The final version restores the Superfund excise tax on certain chemicals which expired in 1995.\n  - **Overview** `[WIKI58094__4___2]`:\n   - According to NPR, the version which passed the Senate on July 28 was set to include:\n   - $110 billion for roads, bridges and other major projects;\n   - $11 billion for transportation safety programs;\n   - $39 billion to modernize transit and improve accessibility;\n   - $66 billion for passenger and freight rail;\n   - $7.5 billion to build a national network of electric vehicle chargers;\n   - $73 billion to overhaul the nation's power infrastructure, clean energy transmission, and overall energy policy;\n   - $65 billion for broadband development.\n   - The law would also make the Minority Business Development Agency a permanent agency. It authorizes the DOT to create an organization called the Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Infrastructure (ARPA\u2013I), with a broad remit over transportation research akin to DARPA, HSARPA, IARPA, ARPA-E, and ARPA-H, with the first appropriations of $3.22 million being made in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. Lastly, it broadens the powers of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, to provide faster conflict resolution among agencies, in speeding up infrastructure design approvals.\n  - **Impact on environment and climate** `[WIKI58094__4___3]`:\n   - An October 2021 report written by the REPEAT Project, a partnership between the Evolved Energy Research firm and Princeton University's ZERO Lab, said the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act alone will make only a small reduction in emissions, but as they say:We lack modeling capabilities to reflect the net effect of surface transportation investments in highways (which tend to increase on-road vehicle and freight miles traveled) and rail and public transit (which tend to reduce on-road vehicle and freight miles traveled). These significant programs are therefore not modeled in this analysis, an important limitation of our assessment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.The Georgetown Climate Center tried to estimate how the $599 billion investment for surface transportation in the law can impact emissions from transportation. It created two scenarios: \"high emissions\" and \"low emissions\". In the first scenario, from the money dedicated to highways, more money will go to building new highways, while in the second, more will go to repairing existing highways. The other spending areas characteristics are not so different. The first scenario sees increased cumulative emissions over the years 2022\u20132040 by more than 200 million tons, while the second decreases them by around 250 million tons.\n   - In August 2022, the Boston Consulting Group analyzed the Act and found $41 billion of it would be spent on energy projects germane to climate action, $18 billion on similarly germane transportation projects, $18 billion on \"clean tech\" intended to cut hard-to-abate emissions, $0 on manufacturing, and $34 billion on other climate action provisions.\n   - The law includes the largest federal investment in public transit in history. The law includes spending figures of $105 billion in public transport. It also spends $110 billion on fixing roads and bridges and includes measures for climate change mitigation and improving access for cyclists and pedestrians. Increasing use of public transport and related transit-oriented development can reduce transportation emissions in human settlements by 78% and overall US emissions by 15%.\n   - The law includes spending:\n   - $21 billion for environmental projects\n   - $50 billion for water storage\n   - $15 billion for electric vehicles\n   - $73 billion to overhaul the energy policy of the United States.\n   - $4.7 billion to cap orphan wells abandoned by oil and gas companies\n   - $1 billion to better connect neighborhoods separated by transport infrastructure as part of environmental justice efforts. This $1 billion will be spent through the Reconnecting Communities Pilot (RCP) discretionary grant program that, among other priorities, promotes:\n   - New or improved, affordable transportation options to increase safe mobility and connectivity for all, including for people with disabilities, through lower-carbon travel like walking, cycling, rolling, and transit that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote active travel.\n  - **Energy** `[WIKI58094__4___4]`:\n   - $73 billion will be spent on overhauling the energy policy of the United States. The Boston Consulting Group projects $41 billion of the Act will be germane to climate action in energy. $11 billion of the $73 billion amount will be invested in the electrical grid's adjustment to renewable energy, with some of the money going to new loans for electric power transmission lines and required studies for future transmission needs. $6 billion of that $73 billion will go to domestic nuclear power. Also of that $73 billion, the IIJA invests $45 billion in innovation and industrial policy for key emerging technologies in energy; $430 million\u2013$21 billion in new demonstration projects at the DOE; and nearly $24 billion in onshoring, supply chain resilience, and bolstering U.S.-held competitive advantages in energy; the latter amount will be divided into an $8.6 billion investment in carbon capture and storage, $3 billion in battery material reprocessing, $3 billion in battery recycling, $1 billion in rare-earth minerals stockpiling, and $8 billion in new research hubs for green hydrogen. The DOE has imposed grant requirements on $7 billion of the IIJA's battery and transportation spending, which are meant to promote community benefits agreements, social justice, and formation of trade unions. It created the $225 million Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation program for cities, tribes and counties to revise building codes for electrical and heating work. Finally, the law gives $4.7 billion to cap orphan wells abandoned by oil and gas companies.\n  - **Broadband** `[WIKI58094__4___5]`:\n   - The law invests a total of $65 billion in advancing the U.S. quest for broadband universal service. Of this $65 billion, the law invests $42.45 billion in a new infrastructure grant program by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration called the  Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, with highest priority going to communities with Internet speeds below 25 downstream and 3 upstream Mbps. $2 billion will go to the NTIA's Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program, $1 billion to a new middle mile infrastructure program, $1.44 billion in formula grants to state and territorial digital equity plan implementation, $60 million in formula grants to new digital equity plan development, and $1.25 billion in discretionary grants to \"specific types of political subdivisions to implement digital equity projects\".\n   - The law gives the USDA $5.5 billion of the $65 billion total to deliver broadband to rural communities smaller than 20,000 people, $5 million of which is obligated to utility cooperatives.\n   - The law invests $14.2 billion of the total in the Federal Communications Commission's Affordable Connectivity Program, the successor to the American Rescue Plan's broadband subsidies. It gives a $30 monthly discount on internet services to qualifying low-income families ($75 on tribal lands), and provides a $100 discount on tablets, laptops and desktops for them. The program ran out of funds on April 30, 2024. The law also requires the FCC to return consumer broadband labels it developed in 2016 to statute, to revise its public comment process and to issue rules and model policies for combating digital deployment discrimination, with the United States Attorney General's cooperation, and the Government Accountability Office to deliver a report on updating broadband thresholds by November 2022.\n  - **Water** `[WIKI58094__4___6]`:\n   - To support safe drinking water programs, the law provides:\n   - $11.7 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF)\n   - $15 billion to local water systems for lead service line replacement\n   - $9 billion to address emerging contaminants such as PFAS ($4 billion through the SRF and $5 billion through grants to water utilities)\n   - $3.5 billion to build water and sewer systems for the Indian Health Service.\n   - For surface water programs, such as watershed management and pollution control, the law provides:\n   - $12.7 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to support state and local government water quality programs\n   - $1.7 billion for geographic-based programs including the National Estuary Program, the Great Lakes program and the Chesapeake Bay Program.\n    - **Addressing drought in Western states** `[WIKI58094__4___7]`:\n     - The Act provides $8 billion for helping Western states deal with the Southwestern North American megadrought. Spending for many related projects is included under the category \"Western Water Infrastructure\".\n  - **Bridges** `[WIKI58094__4___8]`:\n   - Prior to the enactment of the infrastructure law in 2021, no dedicated federal bridge funding had existed since fiscal year 2013. The law created two new programs specifically to fund bridge projects:\n    - **Bridge Formula Program (BFP)** `[WIKI58094__4___9]`:\n     - With $27.5 billion over five years, the BFP distributes funds to every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico based on a formula that accounts for each state's cost to replace or rehabilitate its poor or fair condition bridges. Each state is guaranteed a minimum of $45 million per year from this program. At least 15% of each state's funds must be spent on off-system bridges (i.e., public bridges that are not on federal-aid highways), and 3% is set aside each year for bridges on tribal lands. Off-system and tribal bridge projects may be funded with a 100% federal share (as opposed to the standard 80% federal share).\n    - **Bridge Investment Program (BIP)** `[WIKI58094__4___10]`:\n     - With $12.5 billion over five years, the BIP is a competitive grant program to replace, rehabilitate, preserve, or make resiliency improvements to bridges. Half of the funding is reserved for large bridge projects, which are defined as projects that cost over $100 million. Large projects are funded at a maximum 50% federal share, while other projects are funded at a maximum 80% federal share.\n  - **Passenger rail** `[WIKI58094__4___11]`:\n   - The infrastructure law is the largest investment in passenger rail since the 1971 creation of Amtrak (which under the law will receive $22 billion in advance appropriations and $19 billion in fully authorized funds). It directly appropriated $66 billion for rail over a five-year period (including the Amtrak appropriations), of which at least $18 billion is designated for expanding passenger rail service to new corridors, and it authorized an additional $36 billion. Most of this funding for new passenger rail lines is implemented through the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail program, which will receive $36 billion in advance appropriations and $7.5 billion in fully authorized funds. The Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements program will receive $5 billion in advance appropriations and $5 billion in fully authorized funds, while programs for grade separation replacing level crossings will receive $3 billion in advance appropriations and $2.5 billion in fully authorized funds, and the Restoration and Enhancement Grant program intended to revive discontinued passenger rail services will receive $250 million in advance appropriations and $250 million in fully authorized funds. Per the law's requirements, at least $12 billion is available and $3.4\u20134.1 billion authorized for expanding service outside of the Northeast Corridor, and $24 billion is available and $3.4\u20134.1 billion authorized to partially rebuild the Corridor.\n   - To help plan and guide the expansion of passenger rail service beyond the Northeast Corridor, the infrastructure law also created a $1.8 billion Corridor Identification and Development Program. The law also expands eligibility for a potential $23 billion in transit funding to these corridors and changes the allocation methods for state government-supported passenger rail shorter than 750 miles, to encourage states to implement more such service.\n  - **Transit station accessibility** `[WIKI58094__4___12]`:\n   - The law established and authorized $1.75 billion over five years for a new All Stations Accessibility Program (ASAP). This program is designed to improve the accessibility of rail system stations that were built before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). At the time of the infrastructure law's passage, over 900 transit stations were not fully ADA-compliant.\n  - **Highway removal and complete streets** `[WIKI58094__4___13]`:\n   - The law includes $1 billion over five years for Reconnecting Communities planning and construction grants intended to build marginalized community-recommended projects removing or capping highways and railroads, the first $185 million of which were awarded to 45 projects on February 28, 2023. The program was later combined with the Neighborhood Equity and Access program from the Inflation Reduction Act for efficiency reasons, before the next 132 projects were given $3.3 billion in awards on March 13, 2024.\n  - **Charging stations** `[WIKI58094__4___14]`:\n   - The Act creates the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program within the Department of Energy. It provides funding of up to $4.155 billion to state governments for up to 80 percent of eligible project costs, to add substantial open-access electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure along major highway corridors.\n  - **Vehicle safety** `[WIKI58094__4___15]`:\n   - The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to develop a safety mechanism to prevent drunk driving, which causes about 10,000 deaths each year in the United States as of 2021, which will be rolled out in phases for retroactive fitting, and will become mandatory for all new vehicles in 2027. The technology, which is being developed by NHTSA in cooperation with the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety and Swedish automobile safety company Autoliv, consists of a breath-based and a touch-based sensor that stops the car if the driver is above the legal blood alcohol content, and will be open-sourced to automobile manufacturers.\n   - Under the law, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) will be required to develop regulations for a system that can detect distracted, fatigued, or impaired drivers. The NHTSA has recommended implementing a camera-based warning system for the former, similar to a technology mandated by the European Union in July 2022.\n   - The law also requires the NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program to test collision avoidance systems in preparation for new federal regulations; new DOT reporting requirements for statistical data on crashes involving motorized scooters and electric bicycles; new federal regulations on headlamps; research directives on technology to protect pedestrians and cyclists, advanced driver-assistance systems, federal hood and bumper regulations, smart city infrastructure, and self-driving cars; and a new Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) office specializing in cybersecurity.\n  - **Wildlife crossings and conservation** `[WIKI58094__4___16]`:\n   - The infrastructure law created the Wildlife Crossings Pilot Program with $350 million in funding over five years. This is a competitive grant program that funds planning and construction projects that prevent wildlife-vehicle collisions and improve the connectivity of animal habitats.\n   - The law also allocated $1 billion to create the National Culvert Removal, Replacement, and Restoration Grant program to improve the passage of anadromous fish such as salmon.\n- **Implementation and results** `[WIKI58094__5___1]`:\n - Biden's infrastructure advisor and the staffer in charge of implementing the law has been identified as Mitch Landrieu. Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has been identified as the staffer in charge of ensuring the law does not conflict with American foreign policy interests. To support the implementation of the Act, Biden issued Executive Order 14052, which establishes a task force comprising most of his Cabinet. Biden appointed Landrieu and then-United States National Economic Council chief Brian Deese as the task force co-chairs.\n - In May 2022, the Biden administration published a manual on the use of the law, aimed mainly at local authorities. The manual briefly describes the over 350 programs included in the law. Each description includes the aim of the program, its funding and possible recipients, its period of availability, and more. The programs are grouped into four categories: \"Transportation\", \"Climate, Energy and the Environment\", \"Broadband\", and \"Other Programs\".\n - By the law's second anniversary in November 2023, around $400 billion from the law, about a third of all IIJA funding, was allocated to more than 40,000 projects related to infrastructure, transport, and sustainability. By May 2024, the law's halfway mark, the numbers had increased to $454 billion (38 percent of the Act's funds) for more than 56,000 projects, and by the third anniversary in November 2024, they had increased to $568 billion (47 percent) to 68,000 projects, leaving 53 percent of IIJA funds unallocated but showing the administration had been accelerating funding approvals. Public attention has remained relatively low, due in part to slow implementation of projects.\n - The White House offers a \"Map of Progress\" which tracks all spending that resulted from the act.\n  - **Macroeconomic impact** `[WIKI58094__5___2]`:\n   - According to the New Democrat-linked think tank Center for American Progress, the IIJA, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act have together catalyzed over 35,000 public and private investments.  Economists Noah Smith and Joseph Politano credited the three acts together for spurring booms in factory construction and utility jobs, as well as limiting geographic concentrations of key industries to ensure more dispersed job creation nationwide, though they raised issues of whether the three would serve to limit project delays and significantly increase labor productivity in the long term. The Biden administration itself claimed that as of January 10, 2025, the IIJA, CaSA, and IRA together catalyzed $1 trillion in private investment (including $449 billion in electronics and semiconductors, $184 billion in electric vehicles and batteries, $215 billion in clean power, $93 billion in clean energy tech manufacturing and infrastructure, and $51 billion in heavy industry) and over $756.2 billion in public infrastructure spending (including $99 billion in energy aside from tax credits in the IRA).\n  - **Energy and industry** `[WIKI58094__5___3]`:\n   - In September 2023, White House data revealed that 60 percent of the Act's energy and transmission funding (up to that point, totaling $12.31 billion) had been awarded to states that voted majority Republican in the 2020 election cycle. Of the Act's top ten recipients, seven states had voted majority Republican, with Wyoming ($1.95 billion) and Texas ($1.71 billion) in the lead. The largest single energy project to receive Act funds was a Generation IV reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming by the nuclear fission startup TerraPower.\n   - In November 2022, the Biden administration announced it would furnish $550 million for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program for clean energy generators for low-income and minority communities, the first such appropriation since the Recovery Act in 2009. The administration announced the competitive portion would award $8.8 million to 12 communities on October 12, 2023, with the next award applications due in April (later changed to October) 2024. By June 28, 2024, the seventh tranche of funding had been awarded from the EECBG program, totaling about $150 million for 175 communities, with that date's instance seeing $18.5 million awarded to four states and 20 communities.\n   - In April 2023, the Biden administration announced it would award $450 million from the Act to projects that built solar farms on abandoned coal mines. Further support for coal communities followed. In November 2023 the IIJA's Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains announced $275 million in grants would go to seven projects in coal communities, creating 1,500 jobs and leveraging $600 million in private investment. The next October it announced $428 million in grants for 14 projects in coal communities, creating 1,900 jobs and leveraging $500 million in private investments.\n   - On July 12, 2023, the Biden administration announced it would award $90 million from the Act's Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation program to 27 cities and counties to update building energy codes. On March 4, 2024 the DOE announced $90 million more would be awarded from the program later that October.\n   - On October 24, 2023, the administration announced the first $3.46 billion in Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships grants from the Act's $11 billion grid rebuilding authorization, would go to 58 projects in 44 states. A majority are categorized for smart grid projects and eight are categorized as pursuing grid innovation. The investment is the largest in the American grid since the Recovery Act 14 years earlier. According to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, the projects could enable 35 gigawatts of renewable energy to come online by 2030, $8 billion in investments to be catalyzed, and 400 microgrids to be built. On August 6, 2024, the DOE announced the recipients of the next $2.2 billion in GRIP grants, eight grid innovation projects across 18 states adding a total of 13 gigawatts of capacity to the grid and catalyzing $10 billion in investments. On October 18, 2024, the DOE announced nearly $2 billion more in GRIP grants would be awarded to 38 smaller projects in 42 states and the District of Columbia, altogether adding 7.5 gigawatts of capacity to the grid and catalyzing nearly $4.2 billion in investment.\n   - On October 30, 2023, the DOE announced the results of a mandated triennial study that, for the first time in its history, included anticipation of future grid transmission needs; the Act had explicitly required this inclusion. The study found fewer infrastructure investments since 2015 and consistently high prices in the Rust Belt and California since 2018, and projected a 20 to 128 percent increase in transmission would be needed within regions, while interregional transmission would need to increase by 25 to 412 percent. The DOE found the most potential was in better connecting Texas to the Southwest region, the Mississippi Delta and Midwest regions to the Great Plains region, and New York to New England. The DOE also announced the first three recipients of a new $2.5 billion loan program called the Transmission Facilitation Program, created to provide funding to help build up the interstate power grid. They are a line between Quebec, New Hampshire and Vermont, a line between Utah and Nevada; and a line between Arizona and New Mexico. The following April 25, the TFP announced the selection of an extension of the One Nevada Transmission Line northward to Idaho. The next October, the DOE announced that four projects in Maine, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and between Texas and Mississippi, were being awarded a total of $1.5 billion under the TFP; the DOE also released its first ever National Transmission Planning Study to follow up on the Needs Study, forecasting a needed national transmission capacity increase of 2.4 to 3.5 times the 2020 level by 2050 to keep costs low and facilitate the energy transmission, with estimated cost savings ranging from $270 billion to $490 billion.\n   - On November 16, 2023, the Biden administration announced the first recipients of $40.8 million in grants from a workforce training program the Act created, which will provide skills for industrial technology, the building trades and energy auditing. In December 2023 the DOE fulfilled the IIJA's requirement that the designation process for National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors be revised.\n   - On January 17, 2024, more than $104 million were allocated to 31 projects which are expected to increase energy conservation and clean energy use in federal facilities and save $29 million in their first years. The projects advance, among other technologies, heat recovery ventilation, heat pumps, building insulation, and solar thermal panels. On February 13, the Biden administration announced that Chevron Corporation and Fervo Energy would receive $74 million under the law to begin demonstrating the efficacy of enhanced geothermal systems, at a site near The Geysers, California for Chevron, and a site near Milford, Utah for Fervo. On February 27, the Department of Energy announced that under the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas program, 17 projects in rural areas across 20 states and 30 tribal communities had been approved to receive $366 million in grants to decarbonize and densify their grids. A majority of approved projects involved installation of solar panels, grid battery storage, and microgrids.\n   - On March 21, the Biden administration announced that five projects in Arizona, Nevada, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania would receive $475 million from the Act, to build solar and geothermal power plants and energy storage on current and former mine lands. On March 25, 2024, the Biden administration announced the first 33 grant recipients of the Department of Energy's $6 billion Industrial Demonstrations Program to reduce embedded emissions in factories and materials processing, of which the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds $489 million. Cement and concrete industry projects received $1.5 billion in total, steelmaking projects received $1.5 billion, and chemical engineering and refinery projects $1.2 billion. The Biden administration expects these projected to drive 1.4 million tons in carbon emissions cuts; however, most of the grants had yet to be finalized by November 11. On April 30, the Department of Energy announced 19 more recipients across 12 states and 13 tribal communities, of $78 million in award grants from the Act's Energy Improvements in Remote or Rural Areas program, with a majority of projects involving solar power.\n   - On May 13, 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission published Order No. 1977, clarifying a provision in the Act by stating that the Commission has 'backstop siting authority' in case a state agency neglects to hand out a construction permit for a new transmission project.\n   - On September 5, 2024, the Energy Department announced the awarding of over $430 million in incentives to 293 existing hydroelectricity projects, under the Act's Section 40333. On September 20, the DOE announced it would award $3 billion to, and leverage $13 billion in investments in, 25 battery manufacturing and supply chain projects, more than half of which had pledged Project Labor Agreements. 12,000 new jobs across 14 states were projected for creation.\n   - In December 2024, the DOE announced that the first three new NIETCs under the IIJA's process would move closer toward full eligibility for TFP funds under the Act's new process, a corridor on the bed of Lake Erie between Ontario and Pennsylvania, a connector between Colorado, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and a connector between the Dakotas. Notably, the sponsor of the Kansas-Indiana Grain Belt Express requested that it be taken off the eligibility list because they had likely secured enough funding to do so.\n  - **Hydrogen hubs** `[WIKI58094__5___4]`:\n   - The Biden administration awarded $7 billion of the $8 billion appropriation to seven hydrogen research hubs, based in California, eastern Washington, southeastern Pennsylvania, southeastern Texas, Illinois, Minnesota, and West Virginia and affecting projects there and in eight more states, on October 13, 2023. The remaining $1 billion will be used for demand-side economic policies to drive growth in hydrogen use.\n   - Several criticisms of the hubs emerged. Jeff St. John, editor in chief of Canary Media, noted while it does mandate that the DOE create a clean hydrogen definitional standard (which as of October 2023 the DOE had not published), and that the DOE selected applicants who pledged community benefits agreements, the Act does not prescribe metrics or guidelines for measuring emissions from these hubs. Researcher Hannah Story Brown of the watchdog group Revolving Door Project noted that the majority of hub projects announced are powered by fossil fuels, not renewable energy. Staffers for California Governor Gavin Newsom requested that the Treasury Department exempt the state's hub from emissions restrictions, citing poor alignment with the state's plans for 100% renewable energy.\n   - On the first anniversary of the October 2023 announcement, St. John reported that the Californian, Washingtonian, and West Virginian hub collaboratives were the farthest along in working towards finalizing their funding, and the DOE's Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was optimistic, but also that all projects were lagging behind in transparency and community outreach, with several projects seeing corporate partners withdraw. Jael Holzman of the outlet Heatmap News reported that soon after, experts in energy markets pointed at a lack of coordination between the Hub program and the IRA's hydrogen tax credits, price increases for electrolyzers, and the historically low cost of natural gas as additional reasons for the withdrawal of investment in Hub projects.\n   - Later in 2024, the DOE selected the hubs based in California, Washington, Illinois, Texas and West Virginia for near-final deals that together would cost a total $5.3 billion. The final two hubs based in Minnesota and Pennsylvania were not far behind in negotiations.\n  - **Direct air capture hubs** `[WIKI58094__5___5]`:\n   - The Act appropriates $3.5 billion to a new Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program as part of its $8.6 billion carbon capture and storage investment. In August 2023, the DOE selected two projects (leaving two more to be selected), together worth $1.2 billion:\n   - The South Texas Hub in Kleberg County, Texas, run by Carbon Engineering, Occidental Petroleum and Worley Group.\n   - Project Cypress in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, run by Battelle Memorial Institute, Climeworks and Heirloom Carbon Technologies.\n   - The projects together will remove 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and create 4,800 jobs.\n   - In September 2024, the DOE announced it intended to fund up to $1.8 billion more in direct air capture projects, with the full solicitation released on December 17.\n  - **Broadband** `[WIKI58094__5___6]`:\n   - By April 2024, the Affordable Connectivity Program had seen 23 million households enroll in it. As of June 2024, the program has ended.\n  - **Water** `[WIKI58094__5___7]`:\n   - In May 2024, the Biden administration announced $3 billion in funding from the law had been allotted to replace lead water pipes.\n  - **Transportation** `[WIKI58094__5___8]`:\n   - The bill contains $27 billion in funding for specific, concrete programs within the Federal Highway Administration that are already implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, all of which was allotted in November 2023. For example, $7.2 billion is allocated to the \"Transportation Alternatives Set-Aside Program\" (creating more possibilities for biking and walking), $6.4 billion to the \"Carbon Reduction Program\" (reducing emissions from highways), $69 million to the \"Transit-Oriented Development Program\" (enhancing transit-oriented development and improving land use) and more. However, because states have wide discretion over use of funds from other highway programs under the Act, which leads to states with fast population growth investing more in highway expansion, the Act has been projected by Transportation for America to increase carbon emissions by 77 million metric tonnes by 2040 compared to a no-Act baseline.\n   - On December 4, the Department of Energy released a proposed rule clarifying the definition of \"foreign entities of concern\" under the Act's car battery materials provisions, in line with the Inflation Reduction Act's Section 30D.\n   - On December 8, the Biden administration announced it would award $8.2 billion from the Act's Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program to ten construction projects, including Brightline West, the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor, the Keystone Corridor, California High-Speed Rail, the Downeaster and Empire Builder services, a partial rebuilding of Chicago Union Station, and a bridge replacement near Willow on the Alaska Railroad. It also announced the first results of the Act's Corridor ID Program, with $34.5 million being distributed to 15 existing rail upgrades, 47 extensions of rail corridors, and 7 new high-speed rail studies.\n   - The bill included $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging. As of December 2024, 37 charging stations with a total of 226 spots for charging vehicles had been built.\n   - On April 2, 2024, an award announcement was made for the transit-oriented development program, which was expanded under the Act.\n  - **Ecosystems** `[WIKI58094__5___9]`:\n   - In 2023 an agreement between seven states was achieved, aiming to preserve the Colorado River water system from collapse due to poor management and climate change. The United States is heavily dependent on the river for power generation, drinking water, agriculture, wildlands restoration, and native cultural practices. Some states will reduce water use, receiving compensation for it (totaling $1.2 billion) from the federal government. Many other projects for preserving the river such as water recycling and rainwater harvesting, are advanced. The funding comes from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.\n   - In February 2024, $157 million was allocated to 206 projects linked to ecosystem restoration. The projects are spread all over the territory of the United States and are advanced in cooperation with states, tribes, nonprofits and territories. More than half of them benefit underserved communities. The projects include cleaning up pollution, restoring Central U.S. grasslands including bison populations, protecting birds in Hawaii from extinction, stopping invasive species, restoring salmon populations in Alaska, restoring sagebrush steppes and more. On this occasion United States Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland remarked, \"Nature is our best ally in the fight against climate change.\"\n  - **Climate adaptation** `[WIKI58094__5___10]`:\n   - The bill provides around $7 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for helping communities adapt to different climate-related disasters such as hurricanes, droughts, and heat waves. In August 2023, $3 billion was allocated to different related projects, including 124 projects related to resilient infrastructure and communities (located in \"38 states, one tribe and the District of Columbia\") and 149 projects related to protection from flooding (located in \"28 states and the District of Columbia\"). From the projects related to infrastructure, 64 use nature-based solutions. Some of the most vulnerable communities will receive help for free.\n   - In November 2023, the Biden administration announced that $300 million from FEMA's new Swift Current Initiative created by the Act would go to helping communities impacted by floods recover and grow their resiliency. It also announced that it would award \"$50 million in project awards to improve the reliability of water resources and support ecosystem health in Western states, along with an additional $50 million funding opportunity for water conservation projects and hydropower upgrades.\"\n   - In March 2024, $120 million was delivered to help indigenous peoples in the U.S. adapt to climate change. Of this number, $26 million was allocated from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The efforts will include planning, ecosystem management and restoration, planned relocation, and promotion and use of indigenous knowledge.\n  - **Trump administration actions and the courts** `[WIKI58094__5___11]`:\n   - In January 2025, the incoming Trump administration froze selected IIJA grants. However, that April, federal judge Mary McElroy ruled on a case brought by Rhode Island conservation groups that the IIJA grants had to be unfrozen, citing constitutionality concerns.\n  - **By state** `[WIKI58094__5___12]`:\n\n    - **Florida** `[WIKI58094__5___13]`:\n     - Around $1.1 billion was allocated for restoration of the Everglades ecosystems. In March 2024, Marco Rubio, supported by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, demanded $725 million more, as the rising levels of water in the Lake Okeechobee created additional problems.\n    - **Wisconsin** `[WIKI58094__5___14]`:\n     - In October 2023, $450 million (including $275 million from the bill) was delivered to clean the Milwaukee River estuary of Polychlorinated biphenyl, heavy metals, and oil products. This pollution had negative effects on surrounding communities for a long time. This is the most funding ever distributed by a Great Lakes cleanup program.\n- **Reactions** `[WIKI58094__6___1]`:\n\n  - **Congress** `[WIKI58094__6___2]`:\n   - Republican senators balked at Biden's tandem plan to pass both a bipartisan plan and a separate Democratic-supported reconciliation bill. McConnell criticized Biden for \"caving\" to his own party by issuing an \"ultimatum\" that he would not sign the bipartisan bill without a separate reconciliation package. After Biden walked back his comments, Republican senators restated their confidence in the bipartisan bill. A Yahoo! News/YouGov poll conducted in late June found that 60% of Republican voters favored the plan.\n   - On June 20, 2021, Senator Bernie Sanders stated that he would not support paying for the bill via a proposed gas tax or a surcharge on electric vehicles.\n   - On June 28, 2021, Sunrise Movement and several progressive representatives performed a protest at the White House in criticism of the size and scope of Biden's Civilian Climate Corps. Several protesters were arrested for blocking White House entrances.\n   - On July 6, the 58-member bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus stated their support for the bipartisan bill and called for an expeditious and independent House vote. On July 21, a group of 65 former governors and mayors endorsed the plan.\n   - Ahead of a procedural vote on August 7, former president Donald Trump attacked the bill and said he would support Republican primary challengers of senators who vote for it. He reiterated his criticisms following the bill's passage by Congress.\n   - Following the bill's passage by Congress in November, Trump criticized it as containing \"only 11% for real Infrastructure\", calling it \"the Elect Democrats in 2022/24 Act\", and attacked Republicans who had supported it, saying in particular that McConnell had lent \"lifelines to those who are destroying\" the country. Various House Republicans also criticized the 13 Republican representatives who voted for the bill. Lauren Boebert described them as \"RINOS\" (Republican in Name Only). Mary Miller called them \"spineless\" and said they helped enact a \"socialist takeover\". Marjorie Taylor Greene called them \"traitors\" and \"American job & energy killers\", who \"are China-First and America-Last\", because they \"agree with Globalist Joe [Biden] that America must depend on China to drive\" electric vehicles. Gary Palmer was criticized for touting funding for the Birmingham Northern Beltline that he added to the bill, while neglecting to mention that he voted against the final bill. Paul Gosar was also criticized for taking credit for the bill's funding for Kingman Airport despite voting against it. Several Republican governors who condemned the bill, including Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Greg Gianforte of Montana, accepted the funding and directed it to various programs.\n  - **Others** `[WIKI58094__6___3]`:\n   - On June 22, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable and No Labels made a joint statement urging the president to consider a bipartisan bill. The former two groups have lobbied for the plan not to raise corporate taxes, and to instead impose user fees and borrow from other federal funds.\n   - According to an early August Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll survey, about 72% of voters support the bill.\n   - On September 24, leaders from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the National Urban League, and other Black American advocacy groups signaled their support for the bill.\n   - On September 25, Peter J. Wallison authored an opinion piece for The Hill in which he argued that Republicans should try to pass the bipartisan bill to prevent it from being used as further leverage to pass the reconciliation bill. Subsequently, Republican House leaders formally opposed the bipartisan bill.\n   - \"Historians, economists and engineers interviewed by The Associated Press welcomed Biden's efforts. But they stressed that $1 trillion was not nearly enough to overcome the government's failure for decades to maintain and upgrade the country's infrastructure.\"\n   - The think tank Transportation for America praised the House version of the bill, but heavily criticized the Senate version for its shortcomings on safety, climate resilience, long-term transit and rail funding and transit-oriented development, and maintenance spending, though it later noted that the final version that became law made small steps to address them.\n   - The nuclear industry favored the legislation as it signaled continued federal government support.\n   - Polling from Third Way and Impact Research released in July 2022 showed that only 24% of voters were aware the bill was signed into law, despite House Democrats holding over 1,000 events to promote it.\n   - Reception to the drunk driver detection and distraction detection requirements have been mixed. Mothers Against Drunk Driving praised the requirement as \"the beginning of the end of drunk driving\". In contrast, the American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern that the technology developed could pose a severe privacy risk to drivers if it collects or stores unnecessary data. Writing for Vice, Aaron Gordon also argued that the technology is likely to have an unacceptably high false-positive rate \u2014 existing ignition interlock devices that are sometimes installed after drunk driving convictions are prone to catastrophic failures.\n   - In October 2023, the Natural Resources Defense Council criticized the IIJA's hydrogen hubs program for its lack of transparency, emphasizing the need for detailed technical reports, public hearings to thwart local NIMBYism and skepticism of hydrogen, and incorporation of environmental justice advocates into project leadership.\n- **See also** `[WIKI58094__7___1]`:\n - CHIPS and Science Act of 2022\n - Inflation Reduction Act of 2022\n - Infrastructure policy of Donald Trump\n- **Notes** `[WIKI58094__8___1]`:\n\n- **References** `[WIKI58094__9___1]`:\n\n- **External links** `[WIKI58094__10___1]`:\n - Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act as amended (PDF/details) in the GPO Statute Compilations collection\n - Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act as enacted (PDF/details) in the US Statutes at Large\n - H.R. 3684 on Congress.gov\n - BIL Maps Dashboard, General Services Administration database displaying geographic information on IIJA projects as of May 26, 2023.

This was planned to be paid for through reinforced Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collection, unspent COVID-19 relief funds, and other sources. By July 2021, the IRS portion of the funding had reportedly been scrapped. Biden stipulated that a separate \"human infrastructure\" bill (notably child care, home care, and climate change) \u2013 later known as the Build Back Better Act \u2013 must also pass, whether through bipartisanship or reconciliation, but later walked back this position. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi similarly stated that the House would not vote on the physical infrastructure bill until the larger bill passes in the Senate, despite the fact that reconciliation overrides much of the obstructive power of the filibuster.\nWhite House officials stated on July 7 that legislative text was nearing completion. On July 14, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced an energy bill expected to be included in the bipartisan package. On July 21, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer put forward a \"shell bill\" for a vote to kick off debate in the Senate, intending to add the bipartisan text via an amendment. On July 25, Republican senator Rob Portman stated that an agreement was \"about 90%\" complete, with mass transit being one remaining point of contention. On July 30, Portman stated that this had been resolved. On July 28, Senator Kyrsten Sinema stated that she did not support a reconciliation bill costing $3.5 trillion, breaking the stalemate and allowing the bipartisan bill to move forward. That day, the Senate voted 67\u201332 to advance the bill, and on July 30, voted 66\u201328 to proceed to its consideration. The legislation text was completed and substituted into the bill on August 1. On August 5, Schumer moved to truncate debate on the legislation, setting up a procedural vote on August 7, which passed 67\u201327. Fifteen or more amendments were expected to receive votes through the weekend. On August 10, the bill was passed by the Senate 69\u201330. It sets aside $550 billion in new spending.\nA procedural vote on a House rule concerning passing both bills passed along party lines on August 24.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "Legislative history", "level_1": "Senate passage", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "Legislative history|Senate passage", "citation": "WIKI58094__2___2"}, {"level": 1, "title": "House passage", "text": "In early August, nine moderate Democrats called for an immediate House vote on the bill, citing a desire not to lose the momentum from the Senate passage of the bill.

While both Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had reversed earlier positions to support passing the bipartisan bill separately, progressives including Congressional Progressive Caucus chairwoman Pramila Jayapal and Senator Bernie Sanders maintained that it be utilized as leverage to pass the most expensive reconciliation bill possible. The lack of a deal caused a late September House vote to be postponed. On October 2, Pelosi set a new deadline of October 31. By October 28, Jayapal and other progressive leaders indicated that they were willing to vote on the bill separately, but Sanders and others opposed this. On October 31, a majority of progressives signaled that they would support both bills.\nVotes on both bills were considered on November 5, but the hesitation of several moderates to pass the reconciliation bill before it could be scored by the Congressional Budget Office made passing the bipartisan bill unlikely.  Negotiations between centrist and progressive Democrats concluded with the centrists committing to passing the Build Back Better Act. The bill ultimately went to a vote, as did a rule to vote on the larger bill once it was scored, passing 228\u2013206; 13 Republicans joined all but six Democrats (members of \"the Squad\") in supporting the legislation.

These significant programs are therefore not modeled in this analysis, an important limitation of our assessment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.The Georgetown Climate Center tried to estimate how the $599 billion investment for surface transportation in the law can impact emissions from transportation. It created two scenarios: \"high emissions\" and \"low emissions\". In the first scenario, from the money dedicated to highways, more money will go to building new highways, while in the second, more will go to repairing existing highways. The other spending areas characteristics are not so different. The first scenario sees increased cumulative emissions over the years 2022\u20132040 by more than 200 million tons, while the second decreases them by around 250 million tons.\nIn August 2022, the Boston Consulting Group analyzed the Act and found $41 billion of it would be spent on energy projects germane to climate action, $18 billion on similarly germane transportation projects, $18 billion on \"clean tech\" intended to cut hard-to-abate emissions, $0 on manufacturing, and $34 billion on other climate action provisions.\nThe law includes the largest federal investment in public transit in history.

The next October, the DOE announced that four projects in Maine, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and between Texas and Mississippi, were being awarded a total of $1.5 billion under the TFP; the DOE also released its first ever National Transmission Planning Study to follow up on the Needs Study, forecasting a needed national transmission capacity increase of 2.4 to 3.5 times the 2020 level by 2050 to keep costs low and facilitate the energy transmission, with estimated cost savings ranging from $270 billion to $490 billion.\nOn November 16, 2023, the Biden administration announced the first recipients of $40.8 million in grants from a workforce training program the Act created, which will provide skills for industrial technology, the building trades and energy auditing. In December 2023 the DOE fulfilled the IIJA's requirement that the designation process for National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors be revised.\nOn January 17, 2024, more than $104 million were allocated to 31 projects which are expected to increase energy conservation and clean energy use in federal facilities and save $29 million in their first years. The projects advance, among other technologies, heat recovery ventilation, heat pumps, building insulation, and solar thermal panels. On February 13, the Biden administration announced that Chevron Corporation and Fervo Energy would receive $74 million under the law to begin demonstrating the efficacy of enhanced geothermal systems, at a site near The Geysers, California for Chevron, and a site near Milford, Utah for Fervo. On February 27, the Department of Energy announced that under the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas program, 17 projects in rural areas across 20 states and 30 tribal communities had been approved to receive $366 million in grants to decarbonize and densify their grids. A majority of approved projects involved installation of solar panels, grid battery storage, and microgrids.\nOn March 21, the Biden administration announced that five projects in Arizona, Nevada, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania would receive $475 million from the Act, to build solar and geothermal power plants and energy storage on current and former mine lands. On March 25, 2024, the Biden administration announced the first 33 grant recipients of the Department of Energy's $6 billion Industrial Demonstrations Program to reduce embedded emissions in factories and materials processing, of which the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds $489 million. Cement and concrete industry projects received $1.5 billion in total, steelmaking projects received $1.5 billion, and chemical engineering and refinery projects $1.2 billion. The Biden administration expects these projected to drive 1.4 million tons in carbon emissions cuts; however, most of the grants had yet to be finalized by November 11.

The Internet in the United States of America in turn provided the foundation for the worldwide Internet of today.\nInternet connections in the United States are largely provided by the private sector and are available in a variety of forms, using a variety of technologies, at a wide range of speeds and costs. In 2000, a majority of U.S. households had at least one personal computer and internet access the following year. In September 2007, a majority of U.S. survey respondents reported having broadband internet at home. In 2019, the United States ranked 3rd in the world for the number of internet users (behind China and India), with 312.32 million users. As of 2019, 90% of adults in America use the internet, either irregularly or frequently. The United States ranks #1 in the world with 7,000 Internet Service Providers (ISPs) according to the CIA. Internet bandwidth per Internet user was the 43rd highest in the world in 2016.\nInternet top-level domain names specific to the U.S. include .us, .edu, .gov, .mil, .as (American Samoa), .gu (Guam), .mp (Northern Mariana Islands), .pr (Puerto Rico), and .vi (U.S. Virgin Islands). Many U.S.-based organizations and individuals also use generic top-level domains, such as .com, .net, and .org.\n\nOverview\nAccess and speed\nAccess to the Internet can be divided into dial-up and broadband access. Around the start of the 21st century, most residential access was by dial-up, while access from businesses was usually by higher speed connections. In subsequent years dial-up declined in favor of broadband access. Both types of access generally use a modem, which converts digital data to analog for transmission over a particular analog network (ex. the telephone or cable networks).\nDial-up access is a connection to the Internet through a phone line, creating a semi-permanent link to the Internet. Operating on a single channel, it monopolizes the phone line and is the slowest method of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas because it requires no infrastructure other than the already existing telephone network. Dial-up connections typically do not exceed a speed of 56 kbit/s, because they are primarily made via a 56k modem.\nBroadband access includes a wide range of speeds and technologies, all of which provide much faster access to the Internet than dial-up. The term \"broadband\" once had a technical meaning, but today it is more often used as a marketing buzzword to simply mean \"faster\". Broadband connections are continuous or \"always on\" connections, without the need to dial and hangup, and do not monopolize phone lines. Common types of broadband access include DSL (digital subscriber lines), which uses a telephone line, cable Internet access, satellite Internet access, and mobile or wireless broadband, via cell phones or a mobile broadband modem, through a cellular or wireless network, and from a cell tower. In 2015, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defined broadband as any connection with a download speed of at least 25 Mbit/s and an upload speed of at least 3 Mbit/s, though the definition has used a slower speed in the past. In March 2024, the FCC increased the minimums to 100 Mbit/s downloads and 20 Mbit/s uploads for defining broadband.\nThe percentage of the U.S. population using the Internet grew steadily through 2007, and declined slightly in 2008 and 2009. Growth resumed in 2010, and reached its highest level so far (81.0%) in 2012, the latest year for which data is available. 81.0% is slightly above the 2012 figure of 73% for all developed countries. Based on these figures the U.S. ranked 12th out of 206 countries in 2000, fell to 31st out of 209 by 2010, and was back up slightly to 28th out of 211 in 2012. In 2012 the U.S. figure of 81.0% was similar to those of France (83.0%), Belgium (82.0%), Australia (82.3%), Austria (81.0%), Slovakia (80%), Kuwait (79.2%), and Japan (79.1%). The figures for the top ten countries in 2012 ranged from 91.0% for Finland to 96.9% for the Falkland Islands.\nInternet usage in the United States varies widely from state to state. For example, in the U.S. overall in 2011, 77.9% of the population used the Internet. But in that same year (2011), there was a large gap in usage between the top three states - Washington (80.0%), New Hampshire (79.8%) and Minnesota (79.0%) - and the bottom three states - Mississippi (59.0%), New Mexico (60.4%) and Arkansas (61.4%).\nAccording to an April 2018 article in Motherboard, \"In every single state, a portion of the population doesn't have access to broadband, and some have no access to the internet at all.\"\n\nFixed (wired) and wireless broadband penetration have grown steadily, reaching peaks of 28.0% and 89.8% respectively in 2012. These rates place the U.S. above the world average of 25.9% for fixed broadband in developed countries and well above the average of 62.8% for wireless broadband in OECD countries. Wireless broadband subscriptions in the U.S. are primarily mobile-cellular broadband. Because a single Internet subscription may be shared by many people and a single person may have more than one subscription, the penetration rate will not reflect the actual level of access to broadband Internet of the population and penetration rates larger than 100% are possible.\nA 2013 Pew study on home broadband adoption found that 70% of consumers have a high-speed broadband connection. About a third of consumers reported a \"wireless\" high-speed connection,[8] but the report authors suspect that many of these consumers have mistakenly reported wireless connections to a wired DSL or cable connection.[9] Another Pew Research Center survey, results of which were published on February 27, 2014, revealed 68% of American adults connect to the Internet with mobile devices like smartphones or tablet computers. The report also put Internet usage by American adults as high as 87%, while young adults aged between 18 and 29 were at 97%.\nIn measurements made between April and June 2013 (Q2), the United States ranked 8th out of 55 countries with an average connection speed of 8.7 Mbit/s. This represents an increase from 14th out of 49 countries and 5.3 Mbit/s for January to March 2011 (Q1). The global average for Q2 2013 was 3.3 Mbit/s, up from 2.1 Mbit/s for Q1 2011. In Q2 2013 South Korea ranked first at 13.3 Mbit/s, followed by Japan at 12.0 Mbit/s, and Switzerland at 11.0 Mbit/s.\n\nOwnership\nUnlike in countries such as China, Japan and New Zealand, internet infrastructure such as fibre optic cables, 4G LTE, 5G base stations, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) and satellite networks in the United States are owned by private ISP's as opposed to the state, this in conjunction with high concentration of market share among four major players: AT&T (41.4%), Comcast (36.1%), Charter (33.4%) and Verizon (17.4%) as of 2021 allows for the creation of local monopolies whereby providers have little incentive to compete with each other or enter other providers' \"territory\" in order to fix prices and maintain market share.\nSince ownership of underlying infrastructure is decentralised and privatised, the construction of internet infrastructure is also fragmented and driven by profit instead of public need. Given this, government attempts at funding roll out of infrastructure in rural and under-served areas where no financial incentive exists to for private companies to build any remains slow and costly, since the US government is forced to subsidise private ISP's to construct fibre optic cable networks and other key infrastructure.\nAs of 2022, a study by the Fibre Broadband Association estimated that only 43% of US households had access to fibre optic connections with \"Tier 1\" providers such as AT&T, Verizon, Lumen five others building 72% of fiber coverage in the United States. FCC data as of 2019 indicated that some 21.3 million Americans lacked access to fixed broadband with speeds of at 25 Mbit/s down and 3 Mbit/s up. Attempts by the US government to roll out or upgrade key internet infrastructure in any uniform or integrated way remain strongly influenced by corporate interests, lobbying at both the state and federal level and objections to what is perceived as government intervention in free market dynamics.\n\nCompetition\nA lack of competition and consumer choice in the broadband provider market has been cited as the primary reason Internet costs can be high and speeds and access can be poor even in urban areas. In the DSL market, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required incumbent local exchange carriers to lease lines to consumers to competitive local exchange carriers, but changes to FCC regulations in 2005 significantly weakened these requirements. In the cable broadband market, the 1996 law also allowed cable companies to consolidate, resulting in a small number of large companies, which agreed to give each one a monopoly in a certain geographic area.\nLack of competition has also been attributed to past stringent regulation from federal, state, and local levels, which raises barriers to entry. Specifically, such criticism has referenced limitations regarding access to and development of the physical infrastructure necessary to broadband, including right-of-way to land and ownership of utility poles. The Rural Broadband Association, an organization representing rural-centric providers, has pointed to the expensive permits and procedural delays in preventing \"universal\" broadband access. For rural areas such as the ones the RBA represents, financial returns can be insufficient and thus private actors have little incentive to compete over another in establishing relevant facilities. This problem is particularly salient for indigenous parts of the U.S., where tribal lands \"have some of the lowest internet access rates of any demographic\". Policy goals of equity, not profit, have been driving the few access projects targeted towards these communities as a result of unrewarding demand. In other circumstances, where demand is high enough to propel investment, the fixed costs associated with building broadband infrastructure are high enough to deter even the larger providers. Sprint claims it spent \"tens of millions of dollars\" in their checking for compliance with NEPA, a set of environmental impact regulations, that found \"no significant impact\" by the conclusion and ultimately delayed their entrance in that particular geography.\nTo remedy this anti-competitive climate, governments have worked to minimize costs entrants may incur. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded access rights to pole attachments for ISPs with federal subsidies in an aim to encourage provider participation. \nIn 2015, the Federal Communications Commission granted a preemption petition requested by local utility boards in North Carolina and Tennessee over the state laws that, as a result of private provider lobbying, had legally prevented municipalities from entering the broadband market. To reduce costs and expand the market, the FCC has also approved a \"Dig Once\" policy\u2014a mandate that requires cities to implement broadband conduits during construction of federally-funded roads. Because the financial price of laying down fiber constitutes such a large portion of deployment costs, measures sympathetic towards this step of entrance make it easier for more actors to invest.\nA number of counties have also issued ordinances or grants that waive or offset certain fees associated with building infrastructure in order to encourage broadband building projects.\nOutside of regulatory and legislative action, states have at their disposal informal policies that offer other incentives for investment, such as collecting and providing local data to streamline deployment action or communication efforts.\n\nInternet taxes\nIn 1998 the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act halted the expansion of direct taxation of the Internet that had begun in several states in the mid-1990s. The law, however, did not affect sales taxes applied to online purchases which continue to be taxed at varying rates depending on the jurisdiction, in the same way that phone and mail orders are taxed.\nThe absence of direct taxation of the Internet does not mean that all transactions taking place online are free of tax, or even that the Internet is free of all tax. In fact, nearly all online transactions are subject to one form of tax or another. The Internet Tax Freedom Act merely prevents states from imposing their sales tax, or any other kind of gross receipts tax, on certain online services. For example, a state may impose an income or franchise tax on the net income earned by the provider of online services, while the same state would be precluded from imposing its sales tax on the gross receipts of that provider.\n\nNetwork neutrality\nIn the United States, net neutrality, the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) treat all data on the Internet the same, and not discriminate, has been an issue of contention between network users and access providers since the 1990s. To elucidate the term \"net neutrality\", one can apply a metaphor that was given and illustrated by Michael Goodwin: In his illustration, he illustrates ISPs as the driveway that connects a home to the vast network of destinations on the internet, and net neutrality is the principle that prevents ISPs from slowing some traffic or charging a premium fee for other traffic.\nOn August 5, 2005, the FCC reclassified some services as information services rather than telecommunications services, and replaced common carrier requirements on them with a set of four less-restrictive net neutrality principles. These principles, however, are not FCC rules, and therefore not enforceable requirements. Actually implementing the principles requires either official FCC rule-making or federal legislation.\nOn June 6, 2010, the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia in Comcast Corp. v. FCC ruled that the FCC lacks the authority as an information service, under the ancillary statutory authority of Title One of the Communications Act of 1934, to force Internet service providers to keep their networks open, while employing reasonable network management practices, to all forms of legal content.\nOn December 21, 2010, the FCC approved the FCC Open Internet Order banning cable television and telephone service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites such as Netflix. The rules would not keep ISPs from charging more for faster access.\nOn February 26, 2015, the FCC's Open Internet rules went into effect when the FCC designated the Internet as a telecommunications tool and applied to it new \"rules of the road\".\n\"[Open Internet Rules are] designed to protect free expression and innovation on the Internet and promote investment in the nation's broadband networks. The Open Internet rules are grounded in the strongest possible legal foundation by relying on multiple sources of authority, including: Title II of the Communications Act and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As part of this decision, the Commission also refrains (or \"forbears\") from enforcing provisions of Title II that are not relevant to modern broadband service. Together Title II and Section 706 support clear rules of the road, providing the certainty needed for innovators and investors, and the competitive choices and freedom demanded by consumers.\nThe new rules apply to both fixed and mobile broadband service. This approach recognizes advances in technology and the growing significance of mobile broadband Internet access in recent years. These rules will protect consumers no matter how they access the Internet, whether on a desktop computer or a mobile device.\"\nIn summary the new rules are as follows:\n\nNo blocking: broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.\nNo throttling: broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.\nNo paid prioritization: broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind\u2014in other words, no \"fast lanes.\" This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates.\nOn December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to reverse the 2015 Title II classifications of ISPs, and the classifications fell out of use on June 11, 2018.\n\nInternet censorship\nThe strong protections for freedom of speech and expression against federal, state, and local government censorship are rooted in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. These protections extend to the Internet and as a result very little government mandated technical filtering occurs in the U.S. Nevertheless, the Internet in the United States is highly regulated, supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms.\nAfter a decade and half of ongoing contentious debate over content regulation, the country is still very far from reaching political consensus on the acceptable limits of free speech and the best means of protecting minors and policing illegal activity on the Internet. Gambling, cyber security, and dangers to children who frequent social networking sites\u2014real and perceived\u2014are important ongoing debates. Significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies have prevented the more extreme measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the U.S.\nPublic dialogue, legislative debate, and judicial review have produced filtering strategies in the United States that are different from those found in most of the rest of the world. Many government-mandated attempts to regulate content have been barred on First Amendment grounds, often after lengthy legal battles. However, the government has been able to exert pressure indirectly where it cannot directly censor. With the exception of child pornography, content restrictions tend to rely more on the removal of content than blocking; most often these controls rely upon the involvement of private parties, backed by state encouragement or the threat of legal action. In contrast to much of the rest of the world, where ISPs are subject to state mandates, most content regulation in the United States occurs at the private or voluntary level.\n\nBroadband providers\nThe broadband Internet access providers in the United States with more than one million subscribers at the end of Q2 2018 were:\nMbit/s: Megabit per second\nGbit/s: Gigabit per second (1 Gbit/s = 1000 Mbit/s)\n\nIn 2010, four of these companies ranked among the ten largest ISPs in the world in terms of subscribers: Comcast (4th), AT&T (5th), Time Warner (now Charter Spectrum) (7th), and Verizon (8th).\n\nGovernment policy and programs\nWith the advent of the World Wide Web, the commercialization of the Internet, and its spread beyond use within the government and the research and education communities in the 1990s, Internet access became an important public policy and political issue.\n\nNational Information Infrastructure\nThe High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 (HPCA), Pub. L. 102\u2013194, built on prior U.S. efforts toward developing a national networking infrastructure, starting with the ARPANET in the 1960s and the funding of the National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet) in the 1980s. It led to the development of the National Information Infrastructure and included funding for a series of projects under the titles National Research and Education Network (NREN) and High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative which spurred many significant technological developments, such as the Mosaic web browser, and the creation of a high-speed fiber optic computer network. The HPCA provided the framework for the transition of the Internet from a largely government sponsored network to the commercial Internet that followed.\nThe National Science Foundation banned commercial ISPs, permitting only government agencies and universities to use the internet until 1989. \"The World\" materialized as the first commercial ISP. By 1991, the NSF lifted the ban and the commercial ISP business grew rapidly.\n\nUniversal Service Fund\nUniversal service is a program dating back to early in the 20th century with a goal to encourage/require the interconnection of telephone networks operated by different providers. Over time this grew into the more general goal of providing telephone service to everyone in the United States at a reasonable price. When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 it provided for the creation of a Universal Service Fund to help meet the challenges and opportunities of the digital information age. The Universal Service Fund (USF) was established in 1997 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement the goals of the Telecommunications Act.\nThe Telecommunications Act requires all telecommunications companies to make equitable and non-discriminatory contributions to the USF. Under the supervision of the FCC, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), is responsible for allocating money from the central fund to four programs: High Cost, Low Income, Rural Health Care, and Schools and Libraries (E-rate). These programs are designed to:\n\nPromote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable, and affordable rates;\nIncrease access to advanced telecommunications services throughout the Nation;\nAdvance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas;\nIncrease access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities; and\nProvide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs.\nTelecommunications companies may, but are not required to, charge their customers a fee to recover the costs of contributing to the Universal Service fund. Consumers may see this reflected in a line-item charge labeled \"Universal Service\" on telecommunications bills. The amount of this charge, if any, and the method used to collect the fee from consumers is determined by the companies and is not mandated by the FCC.\nIn October 2011 the FCC voted to phase out the USF's high-cost program that has been subsidizing voice telephone services in rural areas by shifting $4.5 billion a year in funding over several years to a new Connect America Fund focused on expanding broadband deployment.\n\nSchools and Libraries Program (E-Rate)\nMore formally known as the Schools and Libraries Program, the E-Rate is funded from the Universal Service Fund. The E-Rate provides discounts to K-12 schools and libraries in the United States to reduce the cost of installing and maintaining telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections. The discounts available range from 20% to 90% depending on the poverty level and urban/rural status of the communities where the schools and libraries are located.\nThere has been a good deal of controversy surrounding the E-Rate, including legal challenges from states and telecommunications companies. The impact of the program is hard to measure, but at the beginning of 2005 over 100,000 schools had participated in the program. Annual requests for discounts are roughly three times the $2.25 billion that is available, so while all eligible schools and libraries receive some discounts, some do not receive all of the discounts to which they are entitled under the rules of the program.\n\nRural Health Care Program\nSeventy-eight percent of rural community members have internet access. Like the E-Rate, the Rural Health Care Program (RHC) is funded from the Universal Service Fund. It provides funding to eligible health care providers for telecommunications services, including broadband Internet access, necessary for the provision of health care. The goal of the program is to improve the quality of health care available to patients in rural communities by ensuring that eligible health care providers have access to affordable telecommunications services, most often to implement \"tele-health and tele-medicine\" services, typically a combination of video-conferencing infrastructure and high speed Internet access, to enable doctors and patients in rural hospitals to access specialists in distant cities.\nOver $417 million has been allocated for the construction of 62 statewide or regional broadband telehealth networks in 42 states and three U.S. territories under the Rural Health Care Pilot Program.\nThe Healthcare Connect Fund (HCF) is a new component of the Rural Health Care Program. The HCF will provide a 65 percent discount on eligible expenses related to broadband Internet  connectivity to both individual rural health care providers (HCPs) and consortia, which can include non-rural HCPs (if the consortium has a majority of rural sites). Applications under the new program will be accepted starting in late summer 2013 with funding beginning on January 1, 2014. Discounts for traditional telecommunications will continue to be available under the existing RHC Telecommunications Program.\n\nRural broadband and advanced telecommunications\nThe Rural Utilities Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees several programs designed to bring the benefits of broadband Internet access and advanced telecommunications services to under served areas in the U.S. and its territories:\n\nFarm Bill Broadband Loan Program: Provides loans for funding the costs, on a technology neutral basis, of construction, improvement, and acquisition of facilities and equipment to provide broadband service to eligible rural communities.\nRecovery Act Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP): A one-time program that is now closed, the BIP provided grants and loans to provide access to broadband services.\nCommunity Connect program: Provides grants to assist rural communities expand, construct, purchase, or lease facilities and services to deploy expanded broadband Internet access to all residential and business customers located within a service area and all participating critical community facilities, including funding for up to ten computer access points to be used in a community center.\nDistance Learning and Telemedicine Loan and Grant Program: Provides grants and loans to support acquisition of advanced telecommunications technologies, instructional programming, and technical assistance to provide enhanced learning and health care opportunities for rural residents.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program: Provides long-term direct and guaranteed loans to qualified organizations for the purpose of financing the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and operation of telephone lines, facilities, or systems to furnish and improve telecommunications service in rural areas. All facilities financed must be capable of supporting broadband services.\n\nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\nThe 2009 Stimulus Bill, as it is commonly termed, was enacted by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009. The bill provides funding for broadband grant and loan programs:\n\n$4.7 billion to create the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce to bring broadband to unserved and under-served areas and to facilitate broadband use and adoption.\n$2.5 billion to be distributed by the Department of Agriculture to help bring broadband to rural areas.\nRequired the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop a national broadband plan within one year.\n\nNational Broadband Plan\nInternet access has become a vital tool in development and social progress since the start of the 21st century. As a result, Internet penetration and, more specifically, broadband Internet penetration rates are now treated as key economic indicators. The United States is widely perceived as falling behind in both its rate of broadband Internet penetration and the speed of its broadband infrastructure.\nFor all of these reasons, there were calls for the U.S. to develop, adopt, fund, and implement a National Broadband Plan, which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did in March 2010, after first soliciting public comments from April 2009 through February 2010. The goals of the plan as described on Broadband.gov are:\n\nAt least 100 million U.S. homes should have affordable access to actual download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second and actual upload speeds of at least 50 megabits per second by the year 2020.\nThe United States should lead the world in mobile innovation, with the fastest and most extensive wireless networks of any nation.\nEvery American should have affordable access to robust broadband service, and the means and skills to subscribe if they so choose.\nEvery American community should have affordable access to at least one gigabit per second broadband service to anchor institutions such as schools, hospitals, and government buildings.\nTo ensure the safety of the American people, every first responder should have access to a nationwide, wireless, interoperable broadband public safety network.\nTo ensure that America leads in the clean energy economy, every American should be able to use broadband to track and manage their real-time energy consumption.\n\nEmergency subsidies\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States created an urgent need for many households to be connected to the Internet in order to continue work, school, or health care. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 allocated $3.2 billion to subsidize broadband access for low-income households. The FCC approved a program of $50 monthly payments for service, plus up to $100 to purchase equipment.\n\nSee also\nSatellite Internet access\nBroadband mapping in the United States\nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)\nCommunications in the United States\nAffordable Connectivity Program\nInternet in American Samoa\nInternet in Guam\nInternet in Puerto Rico\nInternet in the United States Virgin Islands\nMass surveillance in the United States\nGlobal surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)\nMunicipal broadband\nNational broadband plans from around the world\nInternet Service Provider\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nFixed Broadband Deployment, F.C.C. Broadband provider summary by location tool", "summary": "The Internet in the United States grew out of the ARPANET, a network sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense during the 1960s. The Internet in the United States of America in turn provided the foundation for the worldwide Internet of today.\nInternet connections in the United States are largely provided by the private sector and are available in a variety of forms, using a variety of technologies, at a wide range of speeds and costs. In 2000, a majority of U.S. households had at least one personal computer and internet access the following year. In September 2007, a majority of U.S. survey respondents reported having broadband internet at home. In 2019, the United States ranked 3rd in the world for the number of internet users (behind China and India), with 312.32 million users. As of 2019, 90% of adults in America use the internet, either irregularly or frequently. The United States ranks #1 in the world with 7,000 Internet Service Providers (ISPs) according to the CIA. Internet bandwidth per Internet user was the 43rd highest in the world in 2016.\nInternet top-level domain names specific to the U.S. include .us, .edu, .gov, .mil, .as (American Samoa), .gu (Guam), .mp (Northern Mariana Islands), .pr (Puerto Rico), and .vi (U.S. Virgin Islands). Many U.S.-based organizations and individuals also use generic top-level domains, such as .com, .net, and .org.", "citation": "WIKI27275", "id": "WIKI27275", "type": "Wikipedia", "doc_id": "27275", "source_document": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_the_United_States", "source_dataset": "Wikipedia", "topics": "", "active": true, "date": "2025-06-08", "text": "**Title**: Internet in the United States\n\n**Report ID:** WIKI27275\n\n**Publication Date:**: 2025-06-08\n\n- **Overview** `[WIKI27275__1___1]`:\n\n  - **Access and speed** `[WIKI27275__1___2]`:\n   - Access to the Internet can be divided into dial-up and broadband access. Around the start of the 21st century, most residential access was by dial-up, while access from businesses was usually by higher speed connections. In subsequent years dial-up declined in favor of broadband access. Both types of access generally use a modem, which converts digital data to analog for transmission over a particular analog network (ex. the telephone or cable networks).\n   - Dial-up access is a connection to the Internet through a phone line, creating a semi-permanent link to the Internet. Operating on a single channel, it monopolizes the phone line and is the slowest method of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas because it requires no infrastructure other than the already existing telephone network. Dial-up connections typically do not exceed a speed of 56 kbit/s, because they are primarily made via a 56k modem.\n   - Broadband access includes a wide range of speeds and technologies, all of which provide much faster access to the Internet than dial-up. The term \"broadband\" once had a technical meaning, but today it is more often used as a marketing buzzword to simply mean \"faster\". Broadband connections are continuous or \"always on\" connections, without the need to dial and hangup, and do not monopolize phone lines. Common types of broadband access include DSL (digital subscriber lines), which uses a telephone line, cable Internet access, satellite Internet access, and mobile or wireless broadband, via cell phones or a mobile broadband modem, through a cellular or wireless network, and from a cell tower. In 2015, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defined broadband as any connection with a download speed of at least 25 Mbit/s and an upload speed of at least 3 Mbit/s, though the definition has used a slower speed in the past. In March 2024, the FCC increased the minimums to 100 Mbit/s downloads and 20 Mbit/s uploads for defining broadband.\n   - The percentage of the U.S. population using the Internet grew steadily through 2007, and declined slightly in 2008 and 2009. Growth resumed in 2010, and reached its highest level so far (81.0%) in 2012, the latest year for which data is available. 81.0% is slightly above the 2012 figure of 73% for all developed countries. Based on these figures the U.S. ranked 12th out of 206 countries in 2000, fell to 31st out of 209 by 2010, and was back up slightly to 28th out of 211 in 2012. In 2012 the U.S. figure of 81.0% was similar to those of France (83.0%), Belgium (82.0%), Australia (82.3%), Austria (81.0%), Slovakia (80%), Kuwait (79.2%), and Japan (79.1%). The figures for the top ten countries in 2012 ranged from 91.0% for Finland to 96.9% for the Falkland Islands.\n   - Internet usage in the United States varies widely from state to state. For example, in the U.S. overall in 2011, 77.9% of the population used the Internet. But in that same year (2011), there was a large gap in usage between the top three states - Washington (80.0%), New Hampshire (79.8%) and Minnesota (79.0%) - and the bottom three states - Mississippi (59.0%), New Mexico (60.4%) and Arkansas (61.4%).\n   - According to an April 2018 article in Motherboard, \"In every single state, a portion of the population doesn't have access to broadband, and some have no access to the internet at all.\"\n   - Fixed (wired) and wireless broadband penetration have grown steadily, reaching peaks of 28.0% and 89.8% respectively in 2012. These rates place the U.S. above the world average of 25.9% for fixed broadband in developed countries and well above the average of 62.8% for wireless broadband in OECD countries. Wireless broadband subscriptions in the U.S. are primarily mobile-cellular broadband. Because a single Internet subscription may be shared by many people and a single person may have more than one subscription, the penetration rate will not reflect the actual level of access to broadband Internet of the population and penetration rates larger than 100% are possible.\n   - A 2013 Pew study on home broadband adoption found that 70% of consumers have a high-speed broadband connection. About a third of consumers reported a \"wireless\" high-speed connection,[8] but the report authors suspect that many of these consumers have mistakenly reported wireless connections to a wired DSL or cable connection.[9] Another Pew Research Center survey, results of which were published on February 27, 2014, revealed 68% of American adults connect to the Internet with mobile devices like smartphones or tablet computers. The report also put Internet usage by American adults as high as 87%, while young adults aged between 18 and 29 were at 97%.\n   - In measurements made between April and June 2013 (Q2), the United States ranked 8th out of 55 countries with an average connection speed of 8.7 Mbit/s. This represents an increase from 14th out of 49 countries and 5.3 Mbit/s for January to March 2011 (Q1). The global average for Q2 2013 was 3.3 Mbit/s, up from 2.1 Mbit/s for Q1 2011. In Q2 2013 South Korea ranked first at 13.3 Mbit/s, followed by Japan at 12.0 Mbit/s, and Switzerland at 11.0 Mbit/s.\n  - **Ownership** `[WIKI27275__1___3]`:\n   - Unlike in countries such as China, Japan and New Zealand, internet infrastructure such as fibre optic cables, 4G LTE, 5G base stations, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) and satellite networks in the United States are owned by private ISP's as opposed to the state, this in conjunction with high concentration of market share among four major players: AT&T (41.4%), Comcast (36.1%), Charter (33.4%) and Verizon (17.4%) as of 2021 allows for the creation of local monopolies whereby providers have little incentive to compete with each other or enter other providers' \"territory\" in order to fix prices and maintain market share.\n   - Since ownership of underlying infrastructure is decentralised and privatised, the construction of internet infrastructure is also fragmented and driven by profit instead of public need. Given this, government attempts at funding roll out of infrastructure in rural and under-served areas where no financial incentive exists to for private companies to build any remains slow and costly, since the US government is forced to subsidise private ISP's to construct fibre optic cable networks and other key infrastructure.\n   - As of 2022, a study by the Fibre Broadband Association estimated that only 43% of US households had access to fibre optic connections with \"Tier 1\" providers such as AT&T, Verizon, Lumen five others building 72% of fiber coverage in the United States. FCC data as of 2019 indicated that some 21.3 million Americans lacked access to fixed broadband with speeds of at 25 Mbit/s down and 3 Mbit/s up. Attempts by the US government to roll out or upgrade key internet infrastructure in any uniform or integrated way remain strongly influenced by corporate interests, lobbying at both the state and federal level and objections to what is perceived as government intervention in free market dynamics.\n  - **Competition** `[WIKI27275__1___4]`:\n   - A lack of competition and consumer choice in the broadband provider market has been cited as the primary reason Internet costs can be high and speeds and access can be poor even in urban areas. In the DSL market, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required incumbent local exchange carriers to lease lines to consumers to competitive local exchange carriers, but changes to FCC regulations in 2005 significantly weakened these requirements. In the cable broadband market, the 1996 law also allowed cable companies to consolidate, resulting in a small number of large companies, which agreed to give each one a monopoly in a certain geographic area.\n   - Lack of competition has also been attributed to past stringent regulation from federal, state, and local levels, which raises barriers to entry. Specifically, such criticism has referenced limitations regarding access to and development of the physical infrastructure necessary to broadband, including right-of-way to land and ownership of utility poles. The Rural Broadband Association, an organization representing rural-centric providers, has pointed to the expensive permits and procedural delays in preventing \"universal\" broadband access. For rural areas such as the ones the RBA represents, financial returns can be insufficient and thus private actors have little incentive to compete over another in establishing relevant facilities. This problem is particularly salient for indigenous parts of the U.S., where tribal lands \"have some of the lowest internet access rates of any demographic\". Policy goals of equity, not profit, have been driving the few access projects targeted towards these communities as a result of unrewarding demand. In other circumstances, where demand is high enough to propel investment, the fixed costs associated with building broadband infrastructure are high enough to deter even the larger providers. Sprint claims it spent \"tens of millions of dollars\" in their checking for compliance with NEPA, a set of environmental impact regulations, that found \"no significant impact\" by the conclusion and ultimately delayed their entrance in that particular geography.\n   - To remedy this anti-competitive climate, governments have worked to minimize costs entrants may incur. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded access rights to pole attachments for ISPs with federal subsidies in an aim to encourage provider participation. \n   - In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission granted a preemption petition requested by local utility boards in North Carolina and Tennessee over the state laws that, as a result of private provider lobbying, had legally prevented municipalities from entering the broadband market. To reduce costs and expand the market, the FCC has also approved a \"Dig Once\" policy\u2014a mandate that requires cities to implement broadband conduits during construction of federally-funded roads. Because the financial price of laying down fiber constitutes such a large portion of deployment costs, measures sympathetic towards this step of entrance make it easier for more actors to invest.\n   - A number of counties have also issued ordinances or grants that waive or offset certain fees associated with building infrastructure in order to encourage broadband building projects.\n   - Outside of regulatory and legislative action, states have at their disposal informal policies that offer other incentives for investment, such as collecting and providing local data to streamline deployment action or communication efforts.\n  - **Internet taxes** `[WIKI27275__1___5]`:\n   - In 1998 the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act halted the expansion of direct taxation of the Internet that had begun in several states in the mid-1990s. The law, however, did not affect sales taxes applied to online purchases which continue to be taxed at varying rates depending on the jurisdiction, in the same way that phone and mail orders are taxed.\n   - The absence of direct taxation of the Internet does not mean that all transactions taking place online are free of tax, or even that the Internet is free of all tax. In fact, nearly all online transactions are subject to one form of tax or another. The Internet Tax Freedom Act merely prevents states from imposing their sales tax, or any other kind of gross receipts tax, on certain online services. For example, a state may impose an income or franchise tax on the net income earned by the provider of online services, while the same state would be precluded from imposing its sales tax on the gross receipts of that provider.\n  - **Network neutrality** `[WIKI27275__1___6]`:\n   - In the United States, net neutrality, the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) treat all data on the Internet the same, and not discriminate, has been an issue of contention between network users and access providers since the 1990s. To elucidate the term \"net neutrality\", one can apply a metaphor that was given and illustrated by Michael Goodwin: In his illustration, he illustrates ISPs as the driveway that connects a home to the vast network of destinations on the internet, and net neutrality is the principle that prevents ISPs from slowing some traffic or charging a premium fee for other traffic.\n   - On August 5, 2005, the FCC reclassified some services as information services rather than telecommunications services, and replaced common carrier requirements on them with a set of four less-restrictive net neutrality principles. These principles, however, are not FCC rules, and therefore not enforceable requirements. Actually implementing the principles requires either official FCC rule-making or federal legislation.\n   - On June 6, 2010, the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia in Comcast Corp. v. FCC ruled that the FCC lacks the authority as an information service, under the ancillary statutory authority of Title One of the Communications Act of 1934, to force Internet service providers to keep their networks open, while employing reasonable network management practices, to all forms of legal content.\n   - On December 21, 2010, the FCC approved the FCC Open Internet Order banning cable television and telephone service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites such as Netflix. The rules would not keep ISPs from charging more for faster access.\n   - On February 26, 2015, the FCC's Open Internet rules went into effect when the FCC designated the Internet as a telecommunications tool and applied to it new \"rules of the road\".\n   - \"[Open Internet Rules are] designed to protect free expression and innovation on the Internet and promote investment in the nation's broadband networks. The Open Internet rules are grounded in the strongest possible legal foundation by relying on multiple sources of authority, including: Title II of the Communications Act and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As part of this decision, the Commission also refrains (or \"forbears\") from enforcing provisions of Title II that are not relevant to modern broadband service. Together Title II and Section 706 support clear rules of the road, providing the certainty needed for innovators and investors, and the competitive choices and freedom demanded by consumers.\n   - The new rules apply to both fixed and mobile broadband service. This approach recognizes advances in technology and the growing significance of mobile broadband Internet access in recent years. These rules will protect consumers no matter how they access the Internet, whether on a desktop computer or a mobile device.\"\n   - In summary the new rules are as follows:\n   - No blocking: broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.\n   - No throttling: broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.\n   - No paid prioritization: broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind\u2014in other words, no \"fast lanes.\" This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates.\n   - On December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to reverse the 2015 Title II classifications of ISPs, and the classifications fell out of use on June 11, 2018.\n  - **Internet censorship** `[WIKI27275__1___7]`:\n   - The strong protections for freedom of speech and expression against federal, state, and local government censorship are rooted in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. These protections extend to the Internet and as a result very little government mandated technical filtering occurs in the U.S. Nevertheless, the Internet in the United States is highly regulated, supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms.\n   - After a decade and half of ongoing contentious debate over content regulation, the country is still very far from reaching political consensus on the acceptable limits of free speech and the best means of protecting minors and policing illegal activity on the Internet. Gambling, cyber security, and dangers to children who frequent social networking sites\u2014real and perceived\u2014are important ongoing debates. Significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies have prevented the more extreme measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the U.S.\n   - Public dialogue, legislative debate, and judicial review have produced filtering strategies in the United States that are different from those found in most of the rest of the world. Many government-mandated attempts to regulate content have been barred on First Amendment grounds, often after lengthy legal battles. However, the government has been able to exert pressure indirectly where it cannot directly censor. With the exception of child pornography, content restrictions tend to rely more on the removal of content than blocking; most often these controls rely upon the involvement of private parties, backed by state encouragement or the threat of legal action. In contrast to much of the rest of the world, where ISPs are subject to state mandates, most content regulation in the United States occurs at the private or voluntary level.\n- **Broadband providers** `[WIKI27275__2___1]`:\n - The broadband Internet access providers in the United States with more than one million subscribers at the end of Q2 2018 were:\n - Mbit/s: Megabit per second\n - Gbit/s: Gigabit per second (1 Gbit/s = 1000 Mbit/s)\n - In 2010, four of these companies ranked among the ten largest ISPs in the world in terms of subscribers: Comcast (4th), AT&T (5th), Time Warner (now Charter Spectrum) (7th), and Verizon (8th).\n- **Government policy and programs** `[WIKI27275__3___1]`:\n - With the advent of the World Wide Web, the commercialization of the Internet, and its spread beyond use within the government and the research and education communities in the 1990s, Internet access became an important public policy and political issue.\n  - **National Information Infrastructure** `[WIKI27275__3___2]`:\n   - The High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 (HPCA), Pub. L. 102\u2013194, built on prior U.S. efforts toward developing a national networking infrastructure, starting with the ARPANET in the 1960s and the funding of the National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet) in the 1980s. It led to the development of the National Information Infrastructure and included funding for a series of projects under the titles National Research and Education Network (NREN) and High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative which spurred many significant technological developments, such as the Mosaic web browser, and the creation of a high-speed fiber optic computer network. The HPCA provided the framework for the transition of the Internet from a largely government sponsored network to the commercial Internet that followed.\n   - The National Science Foundation banned commercial ISPs, permitting only government agencies and universities to use the internet until 1989. \"The World\" materialized as the first commercial ISP. By 1991, the NSF lifted the ban and the commercial ISP business grew rapidly.\n  - **Universal Service Fund** `[WIKI27275__3___3]`:\n   - Universal service is a program dating back to early in the 20th century with a goal to encourage/require the interconnection of telephone networks operated by different providers. Over time this grew into the more general goal of providing telephone service to everyone in the United States at a reasonable price. When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 it provided for the creation of a Universal Service Fund to help meet the challenges and opportunities of the digital information age. The Universal Service Fund (USF) was established in 1997 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement the goals of the Telecommunications Act.\n   - The Telecommunications Act requires all telecommunications companies to make equitable and non-discriminatory contributions to the USF. Under the supervision of the FCC, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), is responsible for allocating money from the central fund to four programs: High Cost, Low Income, Rural Health Care, and Schools and Libraries (E-rate). These programs are designed to:\n   - Promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable, and affordable rates;\n   - Increase access to advanced telecommunications services throughout the Nation;\n   - Advance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas;\n   - Increase access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities; and\n   - Provide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs.\n   - Telecommunications companies may, but are not required to, charge their customers a fee to recover the costs of contributing to the Universal Service fund. Consumers may see this reflected in a line-item charge labeled \"Universal Service\" on telecommunications bills. The amount of this charge, if any, and the method used to collect the fee from consumers is determined by the companies and is not mandated by the FCC.\n   - In October 2011 the FCC voted to phase out the USF's high-cost program that has been subsidizing voice telephone services in rural areas by shifting $4.5 billion a year in funding over several years to a new Connect America Fund focused on expanding broadband deployment.\n    - **Schools and Libraries Program (E-Rate)** `[WIKI27275__3___4]`:\n     - More formally known as the Schools and Libraries Program, the E-Rate is funded from the Universal Service Fund. The E-Rate provides discounts to K-12 schools and libraries in the United States to reduce the cost of installing and maintaining telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections. The discounts available range from 20% to 90% depending on the poverty level and urban/rural status of the communities where the schools and libraries are located.\n     - There has been a good deal of controversy surrounding the E-Rate, including legal challenges from states and telecommunications companies. The impact of the program is hard to measure, but at the beginning of 2005 over 100,000 schools had participated in the program. Annual requests for discounts are roughly three times the $2.25 billion that is available, so while all eligible schools and libraries receive some discounts, some do not receive all of the discounts to which they are entitled under the rules of the program.\n    - **Rural Health Care Program** `[WIKI27275__3___5]`:\n     - Seventy-eight percent of rural community members have internet access. Like the E-Rate, the Rural Health Care Program (RHC) is funded from the Universal Service Fund. It provides funding to eligible health care providers for telecommunications services, including broadband Internet access, necessary for the provision of health care. The goal of the program is to improve the quality of health care available to patients in rural communities by ensuring that eligible health care providers have access to affordable telecommunications services, most often to implement \"tele-health and tele-medicine\" services, typically a combination of video-conferencing infrastructure and high speed Internet access, to enable doctors and patients in rural hospitals to access specialists in distant cities.\n     - Over $417 million has been allocated for the construction of 62 statewide or regional broadband telehealth networks in 42 states and three U.S. territories under the Rural Health Care Pilot Program.\n     - The Healthcare Connect Fund (HCF) is a new component of the Rural Health Care Program. The HCF will provide a 65 percent discount on eligible expenses related to broadband Internet  connectivity to both individual rural health care providers (HCPs) and consortia, which can include non-rural HCPs (if the consortium has a majority of rural sites). Applications under the new program will be accepted starting in late summer 2013 with funding beginning on January 1, 2014. Discounts for traditional telecommunications will continue to be available under the existing RHC Telecommunications Program.\n  - **Rural broadband and advanced telecommunications** `[WIKI27275__3___6]`:\n   - The Rural Utilities Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees several programs designed to bring the benefits of broadband Internet access and advanced telecommunications services to under served areas in the U.S. and its territories:\n   - Farm Bill Broadband Loan Program: Provides loans for funding the costs, on a technology neutral basis, of construction, improvement, and acquisition of facilities and equipment to provide broadband service to eligible rural communities.\n   - Recovery Act Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP): A one-time program that is now closed, the BIP provided grants and loans to provide access to broadband services.\n   - Community Connect program: Provides grants to assist rural communities expand, construct, purchase, or lease facilities and services to deploy expanded broadband Internet access to all residential and business customers located within a service area and all participating critical community facilities, including funding for up to ten computer access points to be used in a community center.\n   - Distance Learning and Telemedicine Loan and Grant Program: Provides grants and loans to support acquisition of advanced telecommunications technologies, instructional programming, and technical assistance to provide enhanced learning and health care opportunities for rural residents.\n   - Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program: Provides long-term direct and guaranteed loans to qualified organizations for the purpose of financing the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and operation of telephone lines, facilities, or systems to furnish and improve telecommunications service in rural areas. All facilities financed must be capable of supporting broadband services.\n  - **American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009** `[WIKI27275__3___7]`:\n   - The 2009 Stimulus Bill, as it is commonly termed, was enacted by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009. The bill provides funding for broadband grant and loan programs:\n   - $4.7 billion to create the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce to bring broadband to unserved and under-served areas and to facilitate broadband use and adoption.\n   - $2.5 billion to be distributed by the Department of Agriculture to help bring broadband to rural areas.\n   - Required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop a national broadband plan within one year.\n    - **National Broadband Plan** `[WIKI27275__3___8]`:\n     - Internet access has become a vital tool in development and social progress since the start of the 21st century. As a result, Internet penetration and, more specifically, broadband Internet penetration rates are now treated as key economic indicators. The United States is widely perceived as falling behind in both its rate of broadband Internet penetration and the speed of its broadband infrastructure.\n     - For all of these reasons, there were calls for the U.S. to develop, adopt, fund, and implement a National Broadband Plan, which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did in March 2010, after first soliciting public comments from April 2009 through February 2010. The goals of the plan as described on Broadband.gov are:\n     - At least 100 million U.S. homes should have affordable access to actual download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second and actual upload speeds of at least 50 megabits per second by the year 2020.\n     - The United States should lead the world in mobile innovation, with the fastest and most extensive wireless networks of any nation.\n     - Every American should have affordable access to robust broadband service, and the means and skills to subscribe if they so choose.\n     - Every American community should have affordable access to at least one gigabit per second broadband service to anchor institutions such as schools, hospitals, and government buildings.\n     - To ensure the safety of the American people, every first responder should have access to a nationwide, wireless, interoperable broadband public safety network.\n     - To ensure that America leads in the clean energy economy, every American should be able to use broadband to track and manage their real-time energy consumption.\n  - **Emergency subsidies** `[WIKI27275__3___9]`:\n   - The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States created an urgent need for many households to be connected to the Internet in order to continue work, school, or health care. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 allocated $3.2 billion to subsidize broadband access for low-income households. The FCC approved a program of $50 monthly payments for service, plus up to $100 to purchase equipment.\n- **See also** `[WIKI27275__4___1]`:\n - Satellite Internet access\n - Broadband mapping in the United States\n - Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)\n - Communications in the United States\n - Affordable Connectivity Program\n - Internet in American Samoa\n - Internet in Guam\n - Internet in Puerto Rico\n - Internet in the United States Virgin Islands\n - Mass surveillance in the United States\n - Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)\n - Municipal broadband\n - National broadband plans from around the world\n - Internet Service Provider\n- **References** `[WIKI27275__5___1]`:\n\n- **External links** `[WIKI27275__6___1]`:\n - Fixed Broadband Deployment, F.C.C.

Around the start of the 21st century, most residential access was by dial-up, while access from businesses was usually by higher speed connections. In subsequent years dial-up declined in favor of broadband access. Both types of access generally use a modem, which converts digital data to analog for transmission over a particular analog network (ex. the telephone or cable networks).\nDial-up access is a connection to the Internet through a phone line, creating a semi-permanent link to the Internet. Operating on a single channel, it monopolizes the phone line and is the slowest method of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas because it requires no infrastructure other than the already existing telephone network. Dial-up connections typically do not exceed a speed of 56 kbit/s, because they are primarily made via a 56k modem.\nBroadband access includes a wide range of speeds and technologies, all of which provide much faster access to the Internet than dial-up. The term \"broadband\" once had a technical meaning, but today it is more often used as a marketing buzzword to simply mean \"faster\". Broadband connections are continuous or \"always on\" connections, without the need to dial and hangup, and do not monopolize phone lines. Common types of broadband access include DSL (digital subscriber lines), which uses a telephone line, cable Internet access, satellite Internet access, and mobile or wireless broadband, via cell phones or a mobile broadband modem, through a cellular or wireless network, and from a cell tower. In 2015, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defined broadband as any connection with a download speed of at least 25 Mbit/s and an upload speed of at least 3 Mbit/s, though the definition has used a slower speed in the past. In March 2024, the FCC increased the minimums to 100 Mbit/s downloads and 20 Mbit/s uploads for defining broadband.\nThe percentage of the U.S. population using the Internet grew steadily through 2007, and declined slightly in 2008 and 2009. Growth resumed in 2010, and reached its highest level so far (81.0%) in 2012, the latest year for which data is available. 81.0% is slightly above the 2012 figure of 73% for all developed countries. Based on these figures the U.S. ranked 12th out of 206 countries in 2000, fell to 31st out of 209 by 2010, and was back up slightly to 28th out of 211 in 2012. In 2012 the U.S. figure of 81.0% was similar to those of France (83.0%), Belgium (82.0%), Australia (82.3%), Austria (81.0%), Slovakia (80%), Kuwait (79.2%), and Japan (79.1%). The figures for the top ten countries in 2012 ranged from 91.0% for Finland to 96.9% for the Falkland Islands.\nInternet usage in the United States varies widely from state to state. For example, in the U.S. overall in 2011, 77.9% of the population used the Internet. But in that same year (2011), there was a large gap in usage between the top three states - Washington (80.0%), New Hampshire (79.8%) and Minnesota (79.0%) - and the bottom three states - Mississippi (59.0%), New Mexico (60.4%) and Arkansas (61.4%).\nAccording to an April 2018 article in Motherboard, \"In every single state, a portion of the population doesn't have access to broadband, and some have no access to the internet at all.\"\n\nFixed (wired) and wireless broadband penetration have grown steadily, reaching peaks of 28.0% and 89.8% respectively in 2012. These rates place the U.S. above the world average of 25.9% for fixed broadband in developed countries and well above the average of 62.8% for wireless broadband in OECD countries. Wireless broadband subscriptions in the U.S. are primarily mobile-cellular broadband. Because a single Internet subscription may be shared by many people and a single person may have more than one subscription, the penetration rate will not reflect the actual level of access to broadband Internet of the population and penetration rates larger than 100% are possible.\nA 2013 Pew study on home broadband adoption found that 70% of consumers have a high-speed broadband connection. About a third of consumers reported a \"wireless\" high-speed connection,[8] but the report authors suspect that many of these consumers have mistakenly reported wireless connections to a wired DSL or cable connection.[9] Another Pew Research Center survey, results of which were published on February 27, 2014, revealed 68% of American adults connect to the Internet with mobile devices like smartphones or tablet computers. The report also put Internet usage by American adults as high as 87%, while young adults aged between 18 and 29 were at 97%.\nIn measurements made between April and June 2013 (Q2), the United States ranked 8th out of 55 countries with an average connection speed of 8.7 Mbit/s. This represents an increase from 14th out of 49 countries and 5.3 Mbit/s for January to March 2011 (Q1). The global average for Q2 2013 was 3.3 Mbit/s, up from 2.1 Mbit/s for Q1 2011. In Q2 2013 South Korea ranked first at 13.3 Mbit/s, followed by Japan at 12.0 Mbit/s, and Switzerland at 11.0 Mbit/s.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "Overview", "level_1": "Access and speed", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "Overview|Access and speed", "citation": "WIKI27275__1___2"}, {"level": 1, "title": "Ownership", "text": "Unlike in countries such as China, Japan and New Zealand, internet infrastructure such as fibre optic cables, 4G LTE, 5G base stations, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) and satellite networks in the United States are owned by private ISP's as opposed to the state, this in conjunction with high concentration of market share among four major players: AT&T (41.4%), Comcast (36.1%), Charter (33.4%) and Verizon (17.4%) as of 2021 allows for the creation of local monopolies whereby providers have little incentive to compete with each other or enter other providers' \"territory\" in order to fix prices and maintain market share.\nSince ownership of underlying infrastructure is decentralised and privatised, the construction of internet infrastructure is also fragmented and driven by profit instead of public need. Given this, government attempts at funding roll out of infrastructure in rural and under-served areas where no financial incentive exists to for private companies to build any remains slow and costly, since the US government is forced to subsidise private ISP's to construct fibre optic cable networks and other key infrastructure.\nAs of 2022, a study by the Fibre Broadband Association estimated that only 43% of US households had access to fibre optic connections with \"Tier 1\" providers such as AT&T, Verizon, Lumen five others building 72% of fiber coverage in the United States. FCC data as of 2019 indicated that some 21.3 million Americans lacked access to fixed broadband with speeds of at 25 Mbit/s down and 3 Mbit/s up. Attempts by the US government to roll out or upgrade key internet infrastructure in any uniform or integrated way remain strongly influenced by corporate interests, lobbying at both the state and federal level and objections to what is perceived as government intervention in free market dynamics.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "Overview", "level_1": "Ownership", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "Overview|Ownership", "citation": "WIKI27275__1___3"}, {"level": 1, "title": "Competition", "text": "A lack of competition and consumer choice in the broadband provider market has been cited as the primary reason Internet costs can be high and speeds and access can be poor even in urban areas. In the DSL market, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required incumbent local exchange carriers to lease lines to consumers to competitive local exchange carriers, but changes to FCC regulations in 2005 significantly weakened these requirements. In the cable broadband market, the 1996 law also allowed cable companies to consolidate, resulting in a small number of large companies, which agreed to give each one a monopoly in a certain geographic area.\nLack of competition has also been attributed to past stringent regulation from federal, state, and local levels, which raises barriers to entry. Specifically, such criticism has referenced limitations regarding access to and development of the physical infrastructure necessary to broadband, including right-of-way to land and ownership of utility poles. The Rural Broadband Association, an organization representing rural-centric providers, has pointed to the expensive permits and procedural delays in preventing \"universal\" broadband access. For rural areas such as the ones the RBA represents, financial returns can be insufficient and thus private actors have little incentive to compete over another in establishing relevant facilities. This problem is particularly salient for indigenous parts of the U.S., where tribal lands \"have some of the lowest internet access rates of any demographic\". Policy goals of equity, not profit, have been driving the few access projects targeted towards these communities as a result of unrewarding demand. In other circumstances, where demand is high enough to propel investment, the fixed costs associated with building broadband infrastructure are high enough to deter even the larger providers. Sprint claims it spent \"tens of millions of dollars\" in their checking for compliance with NEPA, a set of environmental impact regulations, that found \"no significant impact\" by the conclusion and ultimately delayed their entrance in that particular geography.\nTo remedy this anti-competitive climate, governments have worked to minimize costs entrants may incur. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded access rights to pole attachments for ISPs with federal subsidies in an aim to encourage provider participation. \nIn 2015, the Federal Communications Commission granted a preemption petition requested by local utility boards in North Carolina and Tennessee over the state laws that, as a result of private provider lobbying, had legally prevented municipalities from entering the broadband market. To reduce costs and expand the market, the FCC has also approved a \"Dig Once\" policy\u2014a mandate that requires cities to implement broadband conduits during construction of federally-funded roads. Because the financial price of laying down fiber constitutes such a large portion of deployment costs, measures sympathetic towards this step of entrance make it easier for more actors to invest.\nA number of counties have also issued ordinances or grants that waive or offset certain fees associated with building infrastructure in order to encourage broadband building projects.\nOutside of regulatory and legislative action, states have at their disposal informal policies that offer other incentives for investment, such as collecting and providing local data to streamline deployment action or communication efforts.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "Overview", "level_1": "Competition", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "Overview|Competition", "citation": "WIKI27275__1___4"}, {"level": 1, "title": "Internet taxes", "text": "In 1998 the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act halted the expansion of direct taxation of the Internet that had begun in several states in the mid-1990s. The law, however, did not affect sales taxes applied to online purchases which continue to be taxed at varying rates depending on the jurisdiction, in the same way that phone and mail orders are taxed.\nThe absence of direct taxation of the Internet does not mean that all transactions taking place online are free of tax, or even that the Internet is free of all tax. In fact, nearly all online transactions are subject to one form of tax or another. The Internet Tax Freedom Act merely prevents states from imposing their sales tax, or any other kind of gross receipts tax, on certain online services. For example, a state may impose an income or franchise tax on the net income earned by the provider of online services, while the same state would be precluded from imposing its sales tax on the gross receipts of that provider.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "Overview", "level_1": "Internet taxes", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "Overview|Internet taxes", "citation": "WIKI27275__1___5"}, {"level": 1, "title": "Network neutrality", "text": "In the United States, net neutrality, the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) treat all data on the Internet the same, and not discriminate, has been an issue of contention between network users and access providers since the 1990s. To elucidate the term \"net neutrality\", one can apply a metaphor that was given and illustrated by Michael Goodwin: In his illustration, he illustrates ISPs as the driveway that connects a home to the vast network of destinations on the internet, and net neutrality is the principle that prevents ISPs from slowing some traffic or charging a premium fee for other traffic.\nOn August 5, 2005, the FCC reclassified some services as information services rather than telecommunications services, and replaced common carrier requirements on them with a set of four less-restrictive net neutrality principles. These principles, however, are not FCC rules, and therefore not enforceable requirements. Actually implementing the principles requires either official FCC rule-making or federal legislation.\nOn June 6, 2010, the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia in Comcast Corp. v. FCC ruled that the FCC lacks the authority as an information service, under the ancillary statutory authority of Title One of the Communications Act of 1934, to force Internet service providers to keep their networks open, while employing reasonable network management practices, to all forms of legal content.\nOn December 21, 2010, the FCC approved the FCC Open Internet Order banning cable television and telephone service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites such as Netflix. The rules would not keep ISPs from charging more for faster access.\nOn February 26, 2015, the FCC's Open Internet rules went into effect when the FCC designated the Internet as a telecommunications tool and applied to it new \"rules of the road\".\n\"[Open Internet Rules are] designed to protect free expression and innovation on the Internet and promote investment in the nation's broadband networks. The Open Internet rules are grounded in the strongest possible legal foundation by relying on multiple sources of authority, including: Title II of the Communications Act and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As part of this decision, the Commission also refrains (or \"forbears\") from enforcing provisions of Title II that are not relevant to modern broadband service. Together Title II and Section 706 support clear rules of the road, providing the certainty needed for innovators and investors, and the competitive choices and freedom demanded by consumers.\nThe new rules apply to both fixed and mobile broadband service. This approach recognizes advances in technology and the growing significance of mobile broadband Internet access in recent years. These rules will protect consumers no matter how they access the Internet, whether on a desktop computer or a mobile device.\"\nIn summary the new rules are as follows:\n\nNo blocking: broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.\nNo throttling: broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.\nNo paid prioritization: broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind\u2014in other words, no \"fast lanes.\" This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates.\nOn December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to reverse the 2015 Title II classifications of ISPs, and the classifications fell out of use on June 11, 2018.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "Overview", "level_1": "Network neutrality", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "Overview|Network neutrality", "citation": "WIKI27275__1___6"}, {"level": 1, "title": "Internet censorship", "text": "The strong protections for freedom of speech and expression against federal, state, and local government censorship are rooted in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. These protections extend to the Internet and as a result very little government mandated technical filtering occurs in the U.S. Nevertheless, the Internet in the United States is highly regulated, supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms.\nAfter a decade and half of ongoing contentious debate over content regulation, the country is still very far from reaching political consensus on the acceptable limits of free speech and the best means of protecting minors and policing illegal activity on the Internet. Gambling, cyber security, and dangers to children who frequent social networking sites\u2014real and perceived\u2014are important ongoing debates. Significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies have prevented the more extreme measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the U.S.\nPublic dialogue, legislative debate, and judicial review have produced filtering strategies in the United States that are different from those found in most of the rest of the world. Many government-mandated attempts to regulate content have been barred on First Amendment grounds, often after lengthy legal battles.

It led to the development of the National Information Infrastructure and included funding for a series of projects under the titles National Research and Education Network (NREN) and High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative which spurred many significant technological developments, such as the Mosaic web browser, and the creation of a high-speed fiber optic computer network.

Over time this grew into the more general goal of providing telephone service to everyone in the United States at a reasonable price. When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 it provided for the creation of a Universal Service Fund to help meet the challenges and opportunities of the digital information age. The Universal Service Fund (USF) was established in 1997 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement the goals of the Telecommunications Act.\nThe Telecommunications Act requires all telecommunications companies to make equitable and non-discriminatory contributions to the USF. Under the supervision of the FCC, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), is responsible for allocating money from the central fund to four programs: High Cost, Low Income, Rural Health Care, and Schools and Libraries (E-rate). These programs are designed to:\n\nPromote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable, and affordable rates;\nIncrease access to advanced telecommunications services throughout the Nation;\nAdvance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas;\nIncrease access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities; and\nProvide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs.\nTelecommunications companies may, but are not required to, charge their customers a fee to recover the costs of contributing to the Universal Service fund. Consumers may see this reflected in a line-item charge labeled \"Universal Service\" on telecommunications bills. The amount of this charge, if any, and the method used to collect the fee from consumers is determined by the companies and is not mandated by the FCC.\nIn October 2011 the FCC voted to phase out the USF's high-cost program that has been subsidizing voice telephone services in rural areas by shifting $4.5 billion a year in funding over several years to a new Connect America Fund focused on expanding broadband deployment.", "hierarchy": {"level_0": "Government policy and programs", "level_1": "Universal Service Fund", "level_2": "", "level_3": "", "level_4": ""}, "hierarchy_string": "Government policy and programs|Universal Service Fund", "citation": "WIKI27275__3___3"}, {"level": 2, "title": "Schools and Libraries Program (E-Rate)", "text": "More formally known as the Schools and Libraries Program, the E-Rate is funded from the Universal Service Fund.

The discounts available range from 20% to 90% depending on the poverty level and urban/rural status of the communities where the schools and libraries are located.\nThere has been a good deal of controversy surrounding the E-Rate, including legal challenges from states and telecommunications companies. The impact of the program is hard to measure, but at the beginning of 2005 over 100,000 schools had participated in the program.

The goal of the program is to improve the quality of health care available to patients in rural communities by ensuring that eligible health care providers have access to affordable telecommunications services, most often to implement \"tele-health and tele-medicine\" services, typically a combination of video-conferencing infrastructure and high speed Internet access, to enable doctors and patients in rural hospitals to access specialists in distant cities.\nOver $417 million has been allocated for the construction of 62 statewide or regional broadband telehealth networks in 42 states and three U.S. territories under the Rural Health Care Pilot Program.\nThe Healthcare Connect Fund (HCF) is a new component of the Rural Health Care Program. The HCF will provide a 65 percent discount on eligible expenses related to broadband Internet  connectivity to both individual rural health care providers (HCPs) and consortia, which can include non-rural HCPs (if the consortium has a majority of rural sites).
