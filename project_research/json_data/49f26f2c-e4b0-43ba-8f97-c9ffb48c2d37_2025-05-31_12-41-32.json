Currently in the United States, residential broadband is primarily provided via cable modem (from the local provider of cable television service), fiber-optic cable, mobile wireless (e.g., smartphones), or over the copper telephone line (digital subscriber line or \"DSL\").  Other broadband technologies include fixed wireless and satellite.\\n Broadband access enables a number of beneficial applications to individual users and to communities.  These include ecommerce, telecommuting, voice service (voice over the internet protocol or \"VOIP\"), distance learning, telemedicine, public safety, and others.  It is becoming generally accepted that broadband access in a community can play an important role in economic development.\\n Access to affordable broadband is viewed as particularly important for the economic development of rural areas because it enables individuals and businesses to participate fully in the online economy regardless of geographical location.  For example, aside from enabling existing businesses to remain in their rural locations, broadband access could attract new business enterprises drawn by lower costs and a more desirable lifestyle.  Essentially, broadband potentially allows businesses and individuals in rural America to live locally while competing globally in an online environment.  A 2016 study from the Hudson Institute found that rural broadband providers directly and indirectly added \\\\$24.1 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015.  The rural broadband industry supported 69,595 jobs in 2015, both through its own employment and the employment that its purchases of goods and services generated.  [1]\\n Given the large potential impact broadband may have on the economic development of rural America, concern has been raised over a \"digital divide\" between rural and urban or suburban areas with respect to broadband deployment.  While there are many examples of rural communities with state-of-the-art telecommunications facilities, [2] recent surveys and studies have indicated that, in general, rural areas tend to lag behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment.  For example\\n \\n- According to the Federal Communications Commission\\\"s (FCC\\\"s)\\n   *Communications Marketplace Report*, \"As of year-end 2017, 94% of the overall population had coverage \\\\[of fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps\\\\], up from 91.9% in 2016.  Nonetheless, the gap in rural and Tribal America remains notable: 24% of Americans in rural areas and 32% of Americans in Tribal lands lack coverage from fixed terrestrial 25 Mbps/3 Mbps broadband, as compared to only 1.5% of Americans in urban areas.  The data demonstrate, however, that the gap between urban and rural or Tribal areas has narrowed each year over the last five years. \" [3] \\n- Also according to the FCC\\\"s *Communications Market Report*, rural\\n   areas continue to lag behind urban areas in mobile broadband deployment.  Although evaluated urban areas saw an increase of 10 Mbps/3 Mbps mobile LTE from 81.9% in 2014 to 92.6% in 2017, such deployment in evaluated rural areas remained relatively flat at about 70%.  [4] \\n- According to January 2018 survey data from the Pew Research Center,\\n   58% of adults in rural areas said they have a high-speed broadband connection at home, as opposed to 67% of adults in urban areas and 70% of adults in suburban areas.  [5] \\n- A November 2017 Census Bureau survey reported by the National\\n   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Digital Nation Data Explorer showed 72.9% of rural residents reporting using the internet, versus 78.5% of urban residents. [6] According to NTIA, the data \"indicates a fairly constant 6-9 percentage point gap between rural and urban communities\\\" internet use over time. \" [7]\\n The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas.  Particularly for wireline broadband technologies\u2014such as cable modem, fiber, and DSL\u2014the greater the geographical distances among customers, the larger the cost to serve those customers.  Thus, there is often less incentive for companies to invest in broadband in rural areas than, for example, in an urban area where there is more demand (more customers with perhaps higher incomes) and less cost to wire the market area.\\n The terrain of rural areas can also be a hindrance, in that it is more expensive to deploy broadband technologies in a mountainous or heavily forested area.  An additional added cost factor for remote areas can be the expense of \"backhaul\" (e.g., the \"middle mile\"), which refers to the installation of a dedicated line that transmits a signal to and from an internet backbone, which is typically located in or near an urban area.\\n Another important broadband availability issue is the extent to which there are multiple broadband providers offering competition and consumer choice.  Typically, multiple providers are more prevalent in urban than in rural areas.

[9] In 2000, given the lagging deployment of broadband in rural areas, Congress and the Administration acted to initiate pilot broadband loan and grant programs within the Rural Utilities Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  While RUS had long maintained telecommunications loan and grant programs (Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, Rural Telephone Bank, and more recently, the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Loans and Grants), none were exclusively dedicated to financing rural broadband deployment.  Title III of the FY2001 agriculture appropriations bill ([P.L. 106-387](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d106:FLD002:@1(106+387))) directed USDA/RUS to conduct a \"pilot program to finance broadband transmission and local dial-up Internet service in areas that meet the definition of \\\"rural area\\\" used for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program. \"\\n Subsequently, on December 5, 2000, RUS announced the availability of \\\\$100 million in loan funding through a one-year pilot program \"to finance the construction and installation of broadband telecommunications services in rural America. \" [10] The broadband pilot loan program was authorized under the authority of the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program (7 U.S.C. 950aaa), and was available to \"legally organized entities\" not located within the boundaries of a city or town having a population in excess of 20,000.\\n The FY2002 agriculture appropriations bill ([P.L. 107-76](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d107:FLD002:@1(107+76))) designated a loan level of \\\\$80 million for broadband loans, and on January 23, 2002, RUS announced that the pilot program would be extended into FY2002, with \\\\$80 million in loans made available to fund many of the applications that did not receive funding during the previous year. [11]\\n Meanwhile, the FY2002 agriculture appropriations bill ([P.L. 107-76](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d107:FLD002:@1(107+76))) allocated \\\\$20 million for a pilot broadband grant program, also authorized under the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program.  On July 8, 2002, RUS announced the availability of \\\\$20 million for a pilot grant program for the provision of broadband service in rural America. The program was specifically targeted to economically challenged rural communities with no existing broadband service.  Grants were made available to entities providing \"community-oriented connectivity,\" which the RUS defined as those entities \"who will connect the critical community facilities including the local schools, libraries, hospitals, police, fire and rescue services and who will operate a community center that provides free and open access to residents. \" [12]\\n The pilot program was extended into FY2003, as the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003 ([P.L. 108-7](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d108:FLD002:@1(108+7))) allocated \\\\$10 million for broadband grants.\\n Currently, RUS has four ongoing programs that have been established to incentivize and subsidize broadband infrastructure investment in unserved and underserved rural areas.  These include the following:\\n \\n- *Rural Broadband Access Loans*\u2014funds the costs of construction,\\n   improvement, or acquisition of facilities and equipment needed to provide service in eligible rural areas. \\n- *Community Connect Grants*\u2014funds broadband deployment into rural\\n   communities where it is not yet economically viable for private sector providers to deliver service. \\n- *Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans* *and Loan Guarantees*\u2014funds\\n   the construction, maintenance, improvement, and expansion of telephone service and broadband in extremely rural areas with a population of 5,000 or less. \\n- *Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants*\u2014principally funds end-user\\n   equipment to help rural communities use telecommunications to link teachers and medical service providers in one area to students and patients in another.\\n In addition, a new broadband loan and grant pilot program\u2014the ReConnect Program\u2014has been established and funded at \\\\$600 million by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ([P.L. 115-141](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+141))).\\n  in the Appendix shows the total amount and number of awards provided by the RUS broadband programs for each state between FY2009 and FY2016.\\n In its April 2017 report, *Rural Broadband Deployment: Improved Consistency with Leading Practices Could Enhance Management of Loan and Grant Programs*, GAO reported that (according to RUS data) since FY2004, RUS has approved 704 broadband projects totaling almost \\\\$8.6 billion in loans and \\\\$144.8 million in grants to deploy telecommunications or broadband infrastructure networks in rural areas.

On July 30, 2015, the RUS published in the *Federal Register* the interim rule (7 C.F.R. part 1738) implementing the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program as reauthorized by the enactment of the Agricultural Act of 2014 ([P.L. 113-79](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d113:FLD002:@1(113+79))), [15] and the interim rule was made final on June 9, 2016.  Entities eligible to receive loans include corporations, limited liability companies, cooperative or mutual organizations, Indian tribes or tribal organizations, and state or local governments.  Eligible areas for funding must be completely contained within a rural area (or composed of multiple rural areas).  Additionally, at least 15% of the households in the proposed funded service areas must be unserved, no part of the proposed service area can have three or more incumbent service providers, and no part of the proposed service area can overlap with the service area of current RUS borrowers or of grantees that were funded by RUS.\\n The latest Notice of Solicitation of Applications (NOSA) announced that RUS is now accepting applications on a rolling basis through September 30, 2019, which will give RUS the ability to request additional information and modifications to submitted applications if necessary. RUS will evaluate the submitted applications every 90 days, and anticipates at least two evaluation periods for FY2019.  The minimum loan amount is \\\\$100,000, while the maximum loan amount is \\\\$25 million.  The NOSA has maintained its definition of broadband service and broadband lending speed at no less than 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload for both mobile and fixed services.

The program was first authorized in 1949 to finance rural telephone service.  Since 1995, RUS has required that networks funded by this program offer broadband service as well.\\n Loans and loan guarantees are available only to rural areas and towns with a population of 5,000 or less.  Eligible areas are those without telecommunications facilities or areas where the applicant is the recognized telecommunications provider.  Funded projects cannot duplicate existing services.\\n The program is authorized to provide several different types of financing, including\\n \\n- direct Treasury rate loans, which bear interest at the government\"s\\n   cost of money (or the current Treasury rate).  Thus, the interest charged varies with the Treasury rate.  As Treasury rates increase, so does the cost to the borrower for these loans. \\n- guaranteed loans, which are provided to borrowers of a nongovernment\\n   lender or from the Federal Financing Bank (FFB).  The interest rate charged on FFB loans is the Treasury rate plus an administrative fee of one-eighth of 1%.  The terms of these loans may vary significantly and allow borrowers more flexibility in meeting their financing needs. \\n- hardship direct loans, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 5% per\\n   year.  These loans are intended only for borrowers with extremely high investment costs in terms of per subscriber service.  These borrowers also have a very low number of subscribers for each mile of telecommunications line constructed.  This low subscriber density inherently increases the cost to serve the most sparsely populated rural areas.  Because of the high cost of the investment needed, these borrowers cannot typically afford higher interest rate loans. [20]\\n The annual loan level for the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee Program is \\\\$690 million.  Currently, the 5% hardship loans are not offered\u2014because of low interest rates, the Treasury and FFB loans can currently offer lower interest rates than the 5% offered by hardship loans. `\\[RL33816__10___1\\]`"}, {"citation": "RL33816__16___1", "text": "## Impact of Universal Service Reform on RUS Broadband Loan Programs\\n RUS has three programs that provide or have provided loans for broadband infrastructure projects: the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee program (also known as the Farm Bill broadband loan program), the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP under the ARRA), and the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program (established in 1949 as the Rural Telephone Loan and Loan Guarantee program). [25]\\n Whereas RUS broadband loans are used as up-front capital to invest in broadband infrastructure, the Federal Communications Commission\\\"s (FCC\\\"s) Universal Service Fund (USF)\u2014specifically, the high cost fund\u2014has functioned as an ongoing subsidy to keep the operation of telecommunications networks in high cost areas profitable for providers. Many RUS telecommunications and broadband borrowers (loan recipients) receive high cost USF subsidies.  In many cases, the subsidy received from USF helps provide the revenue necessary to keep the loan viable. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program is highly dependent on high cost USF revenues, with 99% (476 out of 480 borrowers) receiving interstate high cost USF support.  This is not surprising, given that the RUS Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans are available only to the most rural and high cost areas (towns with populations less than 5,000). Regarding broadband loans, 60% of BIP (stimulus) borrowers draw from state or interstate USF support mechanisms, while 10% of Farm Bill (Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program) broadband borrowers receive interstate high cost USF support. [26]\\n The FCC, in an October 2011 decision, adopted an order that calls for the USF to be transformed, in stages, over a multiyear period\u2014from a mechanism to support voice telephone service to one that supports the deployment, adoption, and use of both fixed and mobile broadband.  More specifically, the high cost program is being phased out and a new fund, the Connect America Fund (CAF), which includes the targeted Mobility Fund and new Remote Areas Fund, is replacing it. [27]\\n During this transition, the uncertainty surrounding the FCC\\\"s proposed methodology for distributing Connect America Fund monies has led many small rural providers to postpone or cancel investment in broadband network upgrades.  [28] According to RUS, \"demand for RUS loans dropped to roughly 37% of the total amount of loan funds appropriated by Congress in FY2012,\" and \"\\\\[c\\\\]urrent and prospective RUS borrowers have communicated their hesitation to increase their outstanding debt and move forward with planned construction due to the recently implemented reductions in USF support and Inter-Carrier Compensation (ICC) payments. \" [29] `\\[RL33816__16___1\\]`"}, {"citation": "RL33816__17___1", "text": "## Appropriations\\n The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program, the Community Connect Grant Program, the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee program, the Rural Broadband ReConnect Program, and the Distance Learning and Telemedicine grant program are funded through the annual Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.

The bill provided \\\\$4.521 million to subsidize a loan level of \\\\$26.991 million for the broadband loan program.  Funding provided for the broadband loan program was intended to promote availability in those areas where there is not otherwise a business case for private investment in a broadband network.

The bill included language requiring at least 15% of the account resources (\\\\$18.4 million) be allocated to each program area.  The committee noted that tribal communities continue to struggle with gaining access to broadband service, and encouraged the Secretary to provide a report that identifies the specific challenges Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) have in gaining access to broadband service and provide a plan for addressing these challenges, including how the Community Connect program can assist ITOs.\\n Regarding telecommunications loans, the House matched the Administration proposal, providing a loan level of \\\\$690 million (\\\\$345 million in direct Treasury loans and \\\\$345 million in FFB loans) with an appropriation of \\\\$0.863 million to subsidize direct Treasury loans.\\n Additionally, the House Appropriations Committee report directed USDA to continue coordinating with the FCC, NTIA, and other related federal agencies to ensure that policies tied to one federal program do not undermine the objectives and functionality of another.  The committee directed the department to prepare a report, in collaboration with the FCC and DOC, detailing areas of responsibility toward addressing rural broadband issues.  The report shall include, but not be limited to, how the programs work complimentarily to one another; how they address broadband issues in unserved and underserved areas, including tribal lands; identify barriers to infrastructure investment in rural areas and tribal lands; data speeds which fixed, wireless, and mobile broadband users in rural areas and tribal lands experience; and cost estimates to increase speeds to 25 Mbps in unserved communities and communities currently being served by speeds less than 25 Mbps.\\n On July 20, 2017, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version of the FY2018 agriculture appropriations bill ([S. 1603](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/z?d115:S.1603:); [S.Rept. 115-131](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/cpquery/R? cp115:FLD010:@1(sr131):)).

Unlike the House and the Administration request, the committee did not include funding for Rural Economic Infrastructure grants.  For telecommunications loans, the Senate matched the House bill and the Administration proposal, providing a loan level of \\\\$690 million (\\\\$345 million in direct Treasury loans and \\\\$345 million in FFB loans) with an appropriation of \\\\$0.863 million to subsidize direct Treasury loans.\\n Regarding the broadband loan program, the committee encouraged RUS to focus expenditures on projects that bring broadband service to currently unserved households, and directed RUS to report back to the committee on administrative efforts to eliminate duplicative or overbuilding of broadband technology.  The committee also recommended that USDA explore a pilot grant program to demonstrate the use of multistrand fiber-optic cable that exists as part of electrical transmission infrastructure to provide state-of-the-art broadband services to currently underserved rural schools and medical centers within a mile of the existing cable.\\n The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ([P.L. 115-141](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+141))) provided \\\\$5 million to subsidize a broadband loan level of \\\\$29.851 million, \\\\$30 million to Community Connect broadband grants, and \\\\$49 million for DLT grants, which included an additional \\\\$20 million to address the opioid epidemic in rural America.

Since their inception, a number of criticisms have emerged. `\\[RL33816__21___1\\]`"}, {"citation": "RL33816__24___1", "text": "### Loans to Communities With Existing Providers\\n The IG report found that RUS too often has given loans to communities with existing broadband service.  The IG report found that \"RUS has not ensured that communities without broadband service receive first priority for loans,\" and that although RUS has a system in place to prioritize loans to unserved communities, the system \"lacks a cutoff date and functions as a rolling selection process\u2014priorities are decided based on the applicants who happen to be in the pool at any given moment. \" [50] The result is that a significant number of communities with some level of preexisting broadband service have received loans.  According to the IG report, of 11 loans awarded in 2004, 66% of the associated communities served by those loans had existing service.  According to RUS, 31% of communities served by all loans (during the period 2003 through early 2005) had preexisting competitive service (not including loans used to upgrade or expand existing service).  [51] In some cases, according to the IG report, \"loans were issued to companies in highly competitive business environments where multiple providers competed for relatively few customers. \" [52] At the May 1, 2007, hearing before the House Subcommittee on Specialty Crops, Rural Development, and Foreign Agriculture, then-RUS Administrator James Andrews testified that of the 69 broadband loans awarded since the program\\\"s inception, 40% of the communities approved for funding were unserved at the time of loan approval, and an additional 15% had only one broadband provider.  [53]\\n Awarding loans to entities in communities with preexisting competitive service raised criticism from competitors who already offer broadband to those communities.  According to the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA), \"RUS loans are being used to unfairly subsidize second and third broadband providers in communities where private risk capital already has been invested to provide broadband service. \" [54] Critics argued that providing loans in areas with preexisting competitive broadband service creates an uneven playing field and discourages further private investment in rural broadband.  [55] In response, RUS stated in the IG report that its policies are in accordance with the statute, and that they address \"the need for competition to increase the quality of services and reduce the cost of those services to the consumer. \" [56] RUS argued that the presence of a competitor does not necessarily mean that an area is adequately served, and additionally, that in order for some borrowers to maintain a viable business in an unserved area, it may be necessary for that company to also be serving more densely populated rural areas where some level of competition already exists.

Benson** In 2018, Congress provided the Secretary of Agriculture authority to establish a new broadband Analyst in Agricultural loan and grant pilot program (the ReConnect Program) to help close the digital divide and expand Policy broadband deployment in rural areas.  The Federal Communications Commission found in 2019 that approximately 14.5 million Americans lack access to broadband, and more than 11 million of them live in rural areas.  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights this gap between those with access to broadband and those without access, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d For-profit internet service providers supply the majority of broadband access in the United States.  These providers typically build the infrastructure needed to deploy broadband to premises within their service areas.  Internet service providers charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.  Providers tend to deploy broadband to areas where they can reach a high number of people at the lowest cost.  Thus, they tend to avoid deploying broadband to areas with high infrastructure costs and small populations, such as rural areas.  Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141).  The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in eligible rural service areas.  Under the current round of funding, *eligible service areas* are defined as areas where 90% or more of households lack broadband access at speeds of at least 100 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload (i.e., 100/20 Mbps).  ReConnect projects are to provide broadband access to all premises within their service areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps.  Congress has provided funding for the ReConnect Program through annual appropriations acts; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136); and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58).  Congress appropriated \\$600 million for the program in FY2018, \\$550 million in FY2019, \\$655 million in FY2020, and \\$635 million in FY2021 through appropriations acts.  Congress appropriated approximately \\$2.363 billion for the ReConnect Program in FY2022.  Congress appropriated \\$1.926 billion through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58, Division J, Title I) and \\$436.605 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103).  As of December 2022, RUS has awarded \\$3.127 billion in ReConnect Program funding for 282 projects in 43 states and U.S. territories through three rounds of funding.  Congress and some stakeholders have identified issues related to the ReConnect Program, including funding levels, extent of service to rural areas, and the potential for duplication of broadband networks.  In addition to P.L. 117-58, seven other bills introduced in the 117th Congress would affect the ReConnect Program.  The bills would combine the ReConnect Program and Rural Broadband Program (H.R. 4374, H.R. 3369), add safeguards to avoid duplication across ReConnect projects and other federally funded broadband projects (H.R. 3435, H.R. 4825, S. 944), and expand the allowable activities that could be funded through the ReConnect Program (H.R. 2400, H.R. 3654).  Additional policy options Congress could consider regarding the ReConnect Program might include addressing broadband affordability in rural areas and training and education to increase broadband adoption among rural residents.

Benson** In 2018, Congress provided the Secretary of Agriculture authority to establish a new broadband Analyst in Agricultural loan and grant pilot program (the ReConnect Program) to help close the digital divide and expand Policy broadband deployment in rural areas.  The Federal Communications Commission found in 2019 that approximately 14.5 million Americans lack access to broadband, and more than 11 million of them live in rural areas.  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights this gap between those with access to broadband and those without access, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d For-profit internet service providers supply the majority of broadband access in the United States.  These providers typically build the infrastructure needed to deploy broadband to premises within their service areas.  Internet service providers charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.  Providers tend to deploy broadband to areas where they can reach a high number of people at the lowest cost.  Thus, they tend to avoid deploying broadband to areas with high infrastructure costs and small populations, such as rural areas.  Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141).  The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in eligible rural service areas.  Under the current round of funding, *eligible service areas* are defined as areas where 90% or more of households lack broadband access at speeds of at least 100 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload (i.e., 100/20 Mbps).  ReConnect projects are to provide broadband access to all premises within their service areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps.  Congress has provided funding for the ReConnect Program through annual appropriations acts; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136); and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58).  Congress appropriated \\\\$600 million for the program in FY2018, \\\\$550 million in FY2019, \\\\$655 million in FY2020, and \\\\$635 million in FY2021 through appropriations acts.  Congress appropriated approximately \\\\$2.363 billion for the ReConnect Program in FY2022.  Congress appropriated \\\\$1.926 billion through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58, Division J, Title I) and \\\\$436.605 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103).  As of December 2022, RUS has awarded \\\\$3.127 billion in ReConnect Program funding for 282 projects in 43 states and U.S. territories through three rounds of funding.  Congress and some stakeholders have identified issues related to the ReConnect Program, including funding levels, extent of service to rural areas, and the potential for duplication of broadband networks.  In addition to P.L. 117-58, seven other bills introduced in the 117th Congress would affect the ReConnect Program.  The bills would combine the ReConnect Program and Rural Broadband Program (H.R. 4374, H.R. 3369), add safeguards to avoid duplication across ReConnect projects and other federally funded broadband projects (H.R. 3435, H.R. 4825, S. 944), and expand the allowable activities that could be funded through the ReConnect Program (H.R. 2400, H.R. 3654).  Additional policy options Congress could consider regarding the ReConnect Program might include addressing broadband affordability in rural areas and training and education to increase broadband adoption among rural residents.

Benson** In 2018, Congress provided the Secretary of Agriculture authority to establish a new broadband Analyst in Agricultural loan and grant pilot program (the ReConnect Program) to help close the digital divide and expand Policy broadband deployment in rural areas.  The Federal Communications Commission found in 2019 that approximately 14.5 million Americans lack access to broadband, and more than 11 million of them live in rural areas.  The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights this gap between those with access to broadband and those without access, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d For-profit internet service providers supply the majority of broadband access in the United States.  These providers typically build the infrastructure needed to deploy broadband to premises within their service areas.  Internet service providers charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.  Providers tend to deploy broadband to areas where they can reach a high number of people at the lowest cost.  Thus, they tend to avoid deploying broadband to areas with high infrastructure costs and small populations, such as rural areas.  Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141).  The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in eligible rural service areas.  Under the current round of funding, *eligible service areas* are defined as areas where 90% or more of households lack broadband access at speeds of at least 100 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload (i.e., 100/20 Mbps).  ReConnect projects are to provide broadband access to all premises within their service areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps.  Congress has provided funding for the ReConnect Program through annual appropriations acts; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136); and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58).  Congress appropriated \\\\$600 million for the program in FY2018, \\\\$550 million in FY2019, \\\\$655 million in FY2020, and \\\\$635 million in FY2021 through appropriations acts.  Congress appropriated approximately \\\\$2.363 billion for the ReConnect Program in FY2022.  Congress appropriated \\\\$1.926 billion through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58, Division J, Title I) and \\\\$436.605 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103).  As of December 2022, RUS has awarded \\\\$3.127 billion in ReConnect Program funding for 282 projects in 43 states and U.S. territories through three rounds of funding.  Congress and some stakeholders have identified issues related to the ReConnect Program, including funding levels, extent of service to rural areas, and the potential for duplication of broadband networks.  In addition to P.L. 117-58, seven other bills introduced in the 117th Congress would affect the ReConnect Program.  The bills would combine the ReConnect Program and Rural Broadband Program (H.R. 4374, H.R. 3369), add safeguards to avoid duplication across ReConnect projects and other federally funded broadband projects (H.R. 3435, H.R. 4825, S. 944), and expand the allowable activities that could be funded through the ReConnect Program (H.R. 2400, H.R. 3654).  Additional policy options Congress could consider regarding the ReConnect Program might include addressing broadband affordability in rural areas and training and education to increase broadband adoption among rural residents.

The pilot program later became known as the ReConnect Program.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers the ReConnect Program, which provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations to build and enhance broadband infrastructure in rural communities.  This report explores \\uf0b7 broadband access in rural America; \\uf0b7 the ReConnect Program (i.e., program authority, funding, and awards); \\uf0b7 comparisons between the ReConnect Program and other USDA broadband programs; \\uf0b7 the program\u2019s effectiveness and related factors; \\uf0b7 bills proposed by the 117th Congress that would affect the program; and \\uf0b7 potential policy options related to the ReConnect program.  **Broadband Access in Rural America** The FCC found that in 2019, an estimated 17% of people living in rural areas in the United States lacked broadband access, and 1% of people living in urban areas lacked broadband access.4 The FCC sets the performance speed benchmark that establishes the level at which fixed broadband service provides advanced telecommunications capabilities.  FCC uses this benchmark to determine whether areas have access to broadband.  The FCC set the performance speed benchmark at 25 megabits per second download and 3 megabits per second upload (25/3 Mbps).  Fixed broadband includes broadband provided through fiber optic cable, cable modem, digital subscriber line, fixed wireless, and satellite.  Researchers have identified three factors that contribute to the digital divide between rural and urban areas: 1.  **Cost. ** It is more expensive to build and maintain broadband infrastructure in rural areas compared with urban areas.  1 Federal Communications Commission (FCC), *Fourteenth Broadband Deployment Report*, FCC 21-18, January 19, 2021.  That report is in response to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires the FCC to report annually on whether advanced telecommunications are being deployed to all Americans and to take action if not.  2 John Lai and Nicole O.

The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that it costs an average of \\\\$27,000 to build one mile of fiber broadband infrastructure.7  ISPs charge monthly user fees to recoup infrastructure costs, cover the cost to provide retail broadband service, and make a profit.8  Rural areas often are geographically large and can include rough terrain, such as mountains. Building broadband infrastructure in rural areas is often more expensive than in urban areas.9  In addition, rural areas have lower populations than urban areas, which often results in fewer potential customers to pay monthly user fees.  Researchers have identified three operating models for deploying broadband to rural areas.10 \\uf0b7 The *retail model* involves a single entity that builds, owns, and operates the broadband network, and it is the most common model in the United States.  This model is impacted by customer density, which is low in rural America. The cost to the entity to provide service is often high for each customer when customers are spread out geographically.  For some, a potential advantage of this model is that a single entity can make all of the profit from operating the business.  A disadvantage could be that a single entity has to take on all of the risk if the business does to succeed.  \\uf0b7 The *open-access model* involves an entity\u2014typically a government entity, such as a municipality\u2014building and owning the broadband network.  The network owner provides network access to multiple ISPs, which then provide retail broadband service to customers.  An advantage of this model, some say, is that customers receive a variety of choices for their broadband service.  A potential disadvantage is that most municipalities operating open-access networks do not generate sufficient revenue to pay for the cost of building the network.  \\uf0b7 The *public-private partnership model* involves a municipality and a commercial ISP working together to deploy broadband to an area.

A possible disadvantage is that public and private entities may have different goals for the broadband project.  Commercial ISPs likely would be focused on generating a profit, while government entities may be focused on providing value to their community and offering low broadband service rates.  **Low Demand for Service** The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has studied internet *adoption* in U.S. homes in both rural and urban areas.11  NTIA calculated how many people had access to broadband service (231 million people) and the portion of those people who elected to subscribe to broadband service.  NTIA found about 76% of people in rural areas use the internet in their homes, compared with 87% of people in urban areas. Research has identified three factors that may contribute to broadband adoption: age, educational attainment, and income level.12  The USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) found that rural residents tend to be older, have lower educational attainment, and lower incomes compared with urban residents\u2014all characteristics that could contribute to lower levels of broadband adoption.13  Studies have shown that broadband usage increases for rural residents when they identify essential tasks that can be completed using the internet.14  Essential tasks include working remotely and helping children access e-learning.15  In those cases, rural residents reportedly will expend to access the internet, including driving to the parking lots of restaurants, libraries, and schools to access free Wi-Fi.  **ReConnect Program** Congress provided authority to USDA to establish the ReConnect Program to address the digital divide in the United States and facilitate broadband deployment in rural areas. The program provides funding for ISPs and other entities to help offset the cost of building broadband infrastructure in rural areas.  This section provides an overview of the program authority, funding, and awards.  It also compares and contrasts the ReConnect Program with other USDA broadband programs.  **Program Authority** On March 23, 2018, Congress provided the underlying authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new broadband loan and grant pilot program through the passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division A, Title VII, \u00a7779).

The primary changes were to the definition of eligible service areas, priority point criteria, project buildout speeds, and matching fund requirements.  The Round 2 FOA defined eligible service areas as areas in which 90% of households did not have sufficient broadband access at speeds of at least 10/1 Mbps, whereas the Round 3 FOA defines eligible service areas as areas where 90% of households do not have sufficient broadband access at 100/20 Mbps.  This change is less restrictive than the previous definition, allowing more rural areas to qualify as eligible service areas than in Rounds 1 and 2. Round 3 prioritizes projects that propose to extend broadband to areas that lack service at speeds of at least 25/3 Mbps.  RUS also changed the priority point criteria for Round 3. Round 2 had nine priority criteria.  Round 3 removes eight of the Round 2 criteria, retaining the criterion for the rurality of the service area.  Priority points are awarded for projects serving the least populated rural areas as measured by the population of the service area per square mile or if a service area is located at least 100 miles from a city that has a population of greater than 50,000 people.  Round 3 added nine additional priority point criteria, including level of existing service, economic need of the communities, and affordability of service.  In addition, the Round 3 FOA increases the required buildout speed for funded projects.  The Round 2 FOA required that projects provide broadband access to the proposed areas at speeds of at least 25/3 Mbps.  Round 3 requires that projects provide broadband access to proposed areas at speeds of at least 100/100 Mbps (i.e., 100 Mbps symmetrical speed).  The Round 3 FOA also removes the matching fund requirement for some areas and applicants.  The Round 2 FOA required that applicants applying for grants provide matching funds for at least 25% of the project costs.  The Round 3 FOA allows tribal government applicants proposing to provide service on their own lands to waive the matching funds requirement.  In addition, any projects in which the proposed service area is comprised of at least 75% socially vulnerable communities may waive the matching funds requirement.

The following section summarizes these issues.  **Funding Levels** Some stakeholders have argued that because the demand for ReConnect Program funds exceeds available funding, Congress might consider increasing program funding.42 Congress appropriated \\\\$100 million for the ReConnect Program through the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136).  USDA reviewed applications submitted to the ReConnect Program and funded nine of those applications using CARES Act funding.  The case could be made that, similar to the CARES Act funding, if Congress were to provide additional funding for the ReConnect Program, then additional qualified applications could be identified to be funded.  Conversely, some Members of Congress requested an audit of the ReConnect Program and cited that \u201cgovernment watchdogs have long raised concerns with USDA\u2019s management of its broadband infrastructure support programs. \u201d43 These Members expressed concern that without proper oversight of the program, there was the potential for overbuilding broadband networks.  **Serving Rural Areas** In 2020, certain Members of the Senate and House sent a letter to the Secretary of Agriculture stating that priority points offered on ReConnect applications favored rural areas with higher populations.44  In Round 1 and Round 2, RUS provided priority points for applications that would serve areas that included health care centers, educational facilities, and community facilities [(**Table 2**)](2022-12-14_R47017_a40122c2bc84a3e34f3fa4bbb1fe9d3eab857016.html#13).

Policy options to increase program efficiency could focus on increasing broadband affordability and broadband adoption in rural communities.  The following section provides an overview of these potential policy options.  **Broadband Affordability** Congress may address rural broadband adoption by focusing on its affordability.  Researchers have found that broadband adoption is lower among rural residents compared with urban residents.51 Cost is one factor among others affecting broadband adoption.  To increase broadband adoption among rural residents, Congress might develop legislation to allow ReConnect funds to be used to make broadband service more affordable for rural residents.  For example, Congress might model potential legislation after the FCC Affordable Connectivity Program, which provides subsidies to ISPs to cover residential broadband service.  The monthly subsidies for providers are up to \\\\$30 per household and up to \\\\$75 per household on tribal lands in cases where the service cannot be maintained at the lower rate of \\\\$30 per household.52  Congress modified, extended, and renamed the FCC Emergency Broadband Benefit Program to create the Affordable Connectivity Program through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58).  Congress funded the FCC\u2019s Emergency Broadband Benefit Program through the Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund,53 which it established to help Americans afford internet service during the COVID-19 pandemic (P.L. 116-260, Division N, Title IX, \u00a7904).  If Congress were to consider this model for the ReConnect Program, it might also consider how to avoid the potential for duplication between any such use of the ReConnect Program and the Affordable Connectivity Program.  **Training and Education** Congress may address rural broadband expansion through training and education efforts.  Researchers have found that rural residents are more likely to access the internet when they identify essential tasks that they can complete using the internet, such as connecting virtually with suppliers and learning about community events or activities.54  To increase broadband adoption by rural residents, Congress might consider enacting legislation to allow ReConnect Program funds to be used for training programs that teach rural residents how to use the internet to accomplish essential tasks. For example, potential programs could provide training on tools that can be used for e-commerce and social media for small businesses.  Training programs could also help rural residents access job training and career opportunities, particularly for telework.  Congress might model any such legislation after USDA\u2019s DLT Program, which provides training and education to rural communities to enhance their interest and ability to participate in telehealth (7 U.S.C. 51 CRS Report R46108, *Demand for Broadband in Rural Areas: Implications for Universal Access*, by Brian E.

Congress could also use the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Workforce Opportunity for Rural Communities Initiative program as a model.55  The program provides grants to support workforce development activities that prepare rural workers for jobs in high-demand occupations that are aligned with a regional or community economic development strategy.  **Author Information** Lisa S.
