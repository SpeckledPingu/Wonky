**3. Policy Background & Context**

* **Field: Historical Context Summary**
    * Around the start of the 21st century, most residential access was by dial-up, while access from businesses was usually by higher speed connections. In subsequent years dial-up declined in favor of broadband access. `[WIKI27275__1___2]` The High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 (HPCA) built on prior U.S. efforts toward developing a national networking infrastructure, starting with the ARPANET in the 1960s and the funding of the National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet) in the 1980s. `[WIKI27275__3___2]` The National Science Foundation banned commercial ISPs, permitting only government agencies and universities to use the internet until 1989. By 1991, the NSF lifted the ban and the commercial ISP business grew rapidly. `[WIKI27275__3___2]`
* **Field: Current Status/Situation Overview**
    * In March 2024, the FCC increased the minimums to 100 Mbit/s downloads and 20 Mbit/s uploads for defining broadband. `[WIKI27275__1___2]` As of 2022, a study estimated that only 43% of US households had access to fibre optic connections. `[WIKI27275__1___3]` FCC data as of 2019 indicated that some 21.3 million Americans lacked access to fixed broadband with speeds of at 25 Mbit/s down and 3 Mbit/s up. `[WIKI27275__1___3]` A lack of competition and consumer choice in the broadband provider market has been cited as the primary reason Internet costs can be high and speeds and access can be poor even in urban areas. `[WIKI27275__1___4]`
* **Field: Key Legislation, Regulations, Constitutional Provisions, or Legal Frameworks Mentioned**
    * Telecommunications Act of 1996: Required incumbent local exchange carriers to lease lines to consumers to competitive local exchange carriers, but changes to FCC regulations in 2005 significantly weakened these requirements. `[WIKI27275__1___4]` Also allowed cable companies to consolidate, resulting in a small number of large companies, which agreed to give each one a monopoly in a certain geographic area. `[WIKI27275__1___4]` Provided for the creation of a Universal Service Fund to help meet the challenges and opportunities of the digital information age. `[WIKI27275__3___3]`
    * Internet Tax Freedom Act (1998): Halted the expansion of direct taxation of the Internet that had begun in several states in the mid-1990s. `[WIKI27275__1___5]`
    * Communications Act of 1934: The United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia in Comcast Corp. v. FCC ruled that the FCC lacks the authority as an information service, under the ancillary statutory authority of Title One of the Communications Act of 1934, to force Internet service providers to keep their networks open, while employing reasonable network management practices, to all forms of legal content. `[WIKI27275__1___6]`
    * Telecommunications Act of 1996: The FCC's Open Internet rules are grounded in the strongest possible legal foundation by relying on multiple sources of authority, including: Title II of the Communications Act and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. `[WIKI27275__1___6]`
    * First Amendment to the United States Constitution: The strong protections for freedom of speech and expression against federal, state, and local government censorship are rooted in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. `[WIKI27275__1___7]`
    * High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 (HPCA): Built on prior U.S. efforts toward developing a national networking infrastructure. `[WIKI27275__3___2]`
    * American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009: Provided funding for broadband grant and loan programs. `[WIKI27275__3___7]`
    * American Rescue Plan Act of 2021: Allocated $3.2 billion to subsidize broadband access for low-income households. `[WIKI27275__3___9]`

        * The FCC defined broadband as any connection with a download speed of at least 25 Mbit/s and an upload speed of at least 3 Mbit/s in 2015, though the definition has used a slower speed in the past. `[WIKI27275__1___2]` In March 2024, the FCC increased the minimums to 100 Mbit/s downloads and 20 Mbit/s uploads for defining broadband. `[WIKI27275__1___2]`
    * **Field: Current Policy/Stance/Program Description or Role of [United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC)]**
        * The FCC approved the FCC Open Internet Order banning cable television and telephone service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites such as Netflix. `[WIKI27275__1___6]` On February 26, 2015, the FCC's Open Internet rules went into effect when the FCC designated the Internet as a telecommunications tool and applied to it new "rules of the road". `[WIKI27275__1___6]` On December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to reverse the 2015 Title II classifications of ISPs, and the classifications fell out of use on June 11, 2018. `[WIKI27275__1___6]` The Universal Service Fund (USF) was established in 1997 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement the goals of the Telecommunications Act. `[WIKI27275__3___3]`
