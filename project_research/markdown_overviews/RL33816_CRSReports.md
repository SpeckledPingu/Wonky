**3. Policy Background & Context**

*   **Field: Historical Context Summary**
    *   In 2000, Congress and the Administration initiated pilot broadband loan and grant programs within the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture due to the lagging deployment of broadband in rural areas. `[RL33816__7___1]` Prior to this, RUS maintained telecommunications loan and grant programs, but none were exclusively dedicated to financing rural broadband deployment. `[RL33816__7___1]` Title III of the FY2001 agriculture appropriations bill directed USDA/RUS to conduct a "pilot program to finance broadband transmission and local dial-up Internet service in areas that meet the definition of \"rural area\" used for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program." `[RL33816__7___1]`
*   **Field: Current Status/Situation Overview**
    *   As of 2017, 24% of Americans in rural areas lacked coverage from fixed terrestrial 25 Mbps/3 Mbps broadband, compared to only 1.5% of Americans in urban areas. `[RL33816__5___1]` The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely a major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas. `[RL33816__5___1]`
*   **Field: Key Legislation, Regulations, Constitutional Provisions, or Legal Frameworks Mentioned**
    *   Rural Electrification Act of 1936: Amended by Section 6103 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 ([P.L. 107-171](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d107:FLD002:@1(107+171))) to authorize a loan and loan guarantee program for broadband service in eligible rural communities. `[RL33816__8___1]`
    *   Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 ([P.L. 110-246](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d110:FLD002:@1(110+246))): Reauthorized the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program. `[RL33816__8___1]`
    *   Agricultural Act of 2014 ([P.L. 113-79](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d113:FLD002:@1(113+79))): Reauthorized the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program. `[RL33816__8___1]`
    *   Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 ([P.L. 115-334](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+334))): Adds a grant component to the broadband loan program, increases the annual authorization level, and changes the proposed service area threshold. `[RL33816__8___1]`
    *   Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ([P.L. 115-141](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+141))): Appropriated \\$600 million to RUS to "conduct a new broadband loan and grant pilot program." `[RL33816__7___1]`
    *   Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ([P.L. 116-6](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d116:FLD002:@1(116+6))): Provided funding for various RUS broadband programs, including the ReConnect Program. `[RL33816__5___1]`

**5. Broader Policy Environment & Report Analysis**

*   **Field: Interactions & Interdependencies Between Domestic Actors/Entities/Policies (If Analyzed)**
    *   The House Appropriations Committee directed USDA to continue coordinating with the FCC, NTIA, and other related federal agencies to ensure that policies tied to one federal program do not undermine the objectives and functionality of another. `[RL33816__18___1]`
*   **Field: Overall Challenges or Systemic Issues Identified by Report**
    *   The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas. `[RL33816__6___1]`
    *   The terrain of rural areas can also be a hindrance, in that it is more expensive to deploy broadband technologies in a mountainous or heavily forested area. `[RL33816__6___1]`
    *   Another important broadband availability issue is the extent to which there are multiple broadband providers offering competition and consumer choice. Typically, multiple providers are more prevalent in urban than in rural areas. `[RL33816__6___1]`
*   **Field: Policy Options or Alternatives Discussed by Report (for addressing the overarching issue or for consideration by policymakers generally)**
    *   The 2018 farm bill includes provisions authorizing a grant component in combination with the broadband loan program; increasing the annual authorization level; raising the proposed service area eligibility threshold; authorizing grants, loans, and loan guarantees for middle mile infrastructure; directing improved federal agency broadband program coordination; and providing eligible applicants with technical assistance and training to prepare applications. `[RL33816__5___1]`
*   **Field: Potential Future Outlook/Scenarios (for the overarching issue, considering actor/entity interactions)**
    *   In the 116 \\[th\\] Congress, appropriations will determine the extent to which these programs will be funded. `[RL33816__5___1]`

**6. Governing/Legislative Body Role & Considerations**

*   **Field: Key Actions by Primary Governing/Legislative Body(ies) (e.g., Legislation, Hearings, Budgetary Allocations, Oversight)**
    *   The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ([P.L. 116-6](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d116:FLD002:@1(116+6))) provided \\$5.83 million to subsidize a rural broadband loan level of \\$29.851 million, \\$30 million to Community Connect broadband grants, \\$47 million for DLT grants, and \\$1.725 million in loan subsidies for a total loan level of \\$690 million for the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee Program. `[RL33816__5___1]` [P.L. 116-6](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d116:FLD002:@1(116+6)) also provided \\$550 million for the ReConnect Program. `[RL33816__5___1]`
    *   On December 20, 2018, the President signed the 2018 farm bill ([P.L. 115-334](http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R? d115:FLD002:@1(115+334)), Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018). `[RL33816__5___1]`
*   **Field: Issues for Governing/Legislative Body(ies) Highlighted by Report**
    *   In the 116 \\[th\\] Congress, appropriations will determine the extent to which these programs will be funded. `[RL33816__5___1]`

---

**7. Report's Key Assumptions & Conclusions (Overall)**

*   **Field: Overarching Assumptions Made by the Report (If Explicitly Stated or Clearly Identifiable)**
    *   Because private providers are unlikely to earn enough revenue to cover the costs of deploying and operating broadband networks in many unserved rural areas, it is unlikely that private investment alone will bring service to these areas. `[RL33816__7___1]`
*   **Field: Report's Main Conclusion(s) or Key Judgments**
    *   Given the large potential impact broadband access may have on the economic development of rural America, concern has been raised over a "digital divide" between rural and urban or suburban areas with respect to broadband deployment. `[RL33816__5___1]`
