*   **Field: Report's Main Conclusion(s) or Key Judgments**
    *   Congress and some stakeholders have identified issues related to the ReConnect Program, including funding levels, extent of service to rural areas, and the potential for duplication of broadband networks. [R47017__1___1]
    *   Additional policy options Congress could consider regarding the ReConnect Program might include addressing broadband affordability in rural areas and training and education to increase broadband adoption among rural residents. [R47017__1___1]
