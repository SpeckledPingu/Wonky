**3. Policy Background & Context**

* **Field: Historical Context Summary**
    * The promotion of universal service in telecommunications was crystallized in the 1960s. `[WIKI49281__1___1]` In the mid-1960s, regulators reallocated increasing profits from long-distance telecommunication to fund subsidies for local telephone connections, institutionalized through the Ozark plan of 1970. `[WIKI49281__1___2]` The Telecommunications Act of 1996 codified the Universal Service Fund. `[WIKI49281__2___2]`
* **Field: Current Status/Situation Overview**
    * The Universal Service Fund supports programs related to traditional telephone technology, but there is rising concern that more recent developments in telecommunications are just as important to the consumer. `[WIKI49281__2___4]` There are discussions over whether the USF should be used to provide services such as broadband internet access. `[WIKI49281__2___4]` As of the third quarter of 2024, telecommunication companies were required to contribute 34.4% of their interstate revenue to the fund. `[WIKI49281__5___1]`
* **Field: Key Legislation, Regulations, Constitutional Provisions, or Legal Frameworks Mentioned**
    * Communications Act of 1934: Some sources point to this act as promoting universal service based on the language of its preamble. `[WIKI49281__1___1]`
    * The Federal-State Commissions Joint Board Act (1971): Formalized the separation of telephone regulation by jurisdiction. `[WIKI49281__1___2]`
    * Telecommunications Act of 1996: Codified the Universal Service Fund and addressed new challenges and opportunities of the digital information age. `[WIKI49281__2___2]`
    * False Claims Act of 1863: Because the E-Rate program is partially funded by government contributions, overcharges can be prosecuted under this act. `[WIKI49281__9___1]`
